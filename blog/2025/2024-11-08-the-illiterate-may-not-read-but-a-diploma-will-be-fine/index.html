But the blank spaces between the lines are like silent wastelands. With the certificate in hand, the truth has nowhere to hide—it is a feast of self-deception, ignorance dancing at the center of the hall, while behind it lies the absence of knowledge and the desolation of thought.</p> <p>True education is not in that piece of paper, but in the light in one’s eyes, the passion in one’s heart, and even in that moment of sudden understanding of the world. A diploma is merely a wooden sign at the door, while literacy is the key to entering the gate of true knowledge.</p> </body></html>
