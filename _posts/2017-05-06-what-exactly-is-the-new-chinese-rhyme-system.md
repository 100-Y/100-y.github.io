**浅谈十六韵与注音符号、汉语拼音**

**注音符号**

注音符号旧时称为“注音字母”，为汉字注音而设定。其实注音，就是在为汉字标记韵。1913年由“中国读音统一会”制定，1918年由北洋政府教育部正式发布，共计39个字母，1920年改订字母顺序，增加一个字母“ㄜ”共计达40个。即：

- 声母：ㄅㄆㄇㄈㄪㄉㄊㄋㄌㄍㄎㄫㄏㄐㄑㄬㄒㄓㄔㄕㄖㄗㄘㄙ
- 介母：ㄧㄨㄩ
- 韵母：ㄚㄛㄜㄝㄞㄟㄠㄡㄢㄣㄤㄥㄦ

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3060-1.webp?w=581)</figure>初期以“读音统一会”所定字音为标准，故有“万（v）、兀（Ng）、广（Gn）”三个字母，后以北京音为标准，“万、兀、广”只作注方言之用。目前在现代标准汉语使用的注音符号有37个（声母21个，韵母16个）。即：

- 声母：ㄅㄆㄇㄈㄉㄊㄋㄌㄍㄎㄏㄐㄑㄒㄓㄔㄕㄖㄗㄘㄙ
- 介母：ㄧㄨㄩ
- 韵母：ㄚㄛㄜㄝㄞㄟㄠㄡㄢㄣㄤㄥㄦ

**注音符号与汉语拼音对照表**

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3062-1.webp?w=607)</figure>注：ㄧ、ㄨ、ㄩ为介母（可作韵母，可做声母）。《汉语拼音方案》对零声母（见下零韵母）音节（以元音a、o、e、i、u、ü开头的音节）的拼写都有规定，凡是i、u、ü 和i、u、ü 开头的音节书写时要加y或w。故汉语拼音中y和w是不能算作声母的。

**汉语拼音韵母表**

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3063-1.webp?w=620)</figure>总结上面两张图，无论是汉语拼音，还是注音符号。我们都可以将韵列为16个基本韵。即：

- 注音符号：ㄚ，ㄛ，ㄜ，ㄝ，ㄞ，ㄟ,ㄠ，ㄡ，ㄢ，ㄣ，ㄤ，ㄥ，ㄦ，ㄨ，ㄩ。
- 汉语拼音：a，o，e，ê，ai，ei，ao，ou，an，en，ang，eng，er，i，u，ü。

方便朗读：啊、喔、鹅、耶、哀、诶、熬、欧、安、恩、昂、亨、儿、衣、乌、迂。

**中华十八韵**

中华民国国民政府于1941年10月10日公告，曾列出十八个韵。从表中，我们可以看出其中十六个韵与上面罗列的十六基本韵相同。

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3064-1.webp?w=640)</figure>十八韵即是由十六基本韵，加上其它复韵母整合而成。唯独多出来两个：五支“ㄭ”，与十八东“ㄨㄥ、ㄩㄥ”。

“ㄭ”（帀），是1932年在“编定《国音常用字汇》特组会议”决定时，为了说明上的方便，添补的一个注音符号。

作为“ㄓ”zhi、“ㄔ”chi、“ㄕ”shi、“ㄖ”ri、“ㄗ”zi、“ㄘ”ci、“ㄙ”si7个声母单独成音节时的省略韵母（即虚母，也叫零韵母）。而十八东即ong（ㄨㄥ） 与iong（ㄩㄥ） 雍，两个也是复韵母。

**中华新韵**

由中华诗词学会于2005年5月颁布，共分十四韵。

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3065-1.webp?w=640)</figure>在了解前面十八韵之后，就可以十分清楚的看明白中华新十四韵了。

新韵将十八韵中的“三歌”，纳入了新韵中的“二波”；即e、o 同韵。然后将十八韵中的“十八东”，也一并纳入成了新韵“十一庚”；即eng、ong 同韵。再将十八韵中的“六儿”与“十一鱼”，一同并入了新韵“十二齐”；即i，er，ü同韵。

整理改动之后的新韵，也确实显得比之前简洁干练了；但也正由于很多不完全相同韵的同韵使用，格律上又不稍加弥补，最后导致做出来的诗、词，与传统诗歌渐行渐远。说透彻明白了，掌握好16基本韵，分清21复韵母，并逐渐注意在格律上进行创作、限制，难免以后不会再作出好的诗词。

**A Brief Discussion on the Sixteen Rhymes, Zhuyin, and Pinyin**

**Zhuyin (Bopomofo)**

Zhuyin, formerly known as the "Zhuyin Alphabet," was developed to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. In essence, Zhuyin serves to mark the rhymes of Chinese characters. It was first established in 1913 by the "Chinese Pronunciation Unification Society" and formally published by the Beiyang government’s Ministry of Education in 1918, consisting of 39 symbols. In 1920, the alphabet was revised to include an additional symbol “ㄜ,” making a total of 40 symbols. These are:

- **Initials (Shengmu)**: ㄅㄆㄇㄈㄪㄉㄊㄋㄌㄍㄎㄫㄏㄐㄑㄬㄒㄓㄔㄕㄖㄗㄘㄙ
- **Medials (Jiemu)**: ㄧㄨㄩ
- **Finals (Yunmu)**: ㄚㄛㄜㄝㄞㄟㄠㄡㄢㄣㄤㄥㄦ

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3060-1.webp?w=581)</figure>Initially, the system followed the pronunciation standard set by the "Pronunciation Unification Society," which included symbols for sounds like “v,” “Ng,” and “Gn.” Later, these symbols were discarded in favor of the Beijing dialect, with the aforementioned sounds only used for dialect annotation. In modern Standard Chinese, Zhuyin is commonly used with 37 symbols: 21 initials and 16 finals:

- **Initials**: ㄅㄆㄇㄈㄉㄊㄋㄌㄍㄎㄏㄐㄑㄒㄓㄔㄕㄖㄗㄘㄙ
- **Medials**: ㄧㄨㄩ
- **Finals**: ㄚㄛㄜㄝㄞㄟㄠㄡㄢㄣㄤㄥㄦ

**Zhuyin (Bopomofo) and Pinyin Correspondence Table**

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3062-1.webp?w=607)</figure>*Note*: The letters ㄧ, ㄨ, and ㄩ are considered medials and can serve both as finals and initials. According to the *Chinese Pinyin Scheme*, syllables beginning with the vowels a, o, e, i, u, and ü are written with "y" or "w" as needed, which means that "y" and "w" in Pinyin are not considered initials.

**Pinyin Finals**

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3063-1.webp?w=620)</figure>To summarize, both Zhuyin and Pinyin systems can be viewed as having 16 basic finals:

- **Zhuyin**: ㄚ, ㄛ, ㄜ, ㄝ, ㄞ, ㄟ, ㄠ, ㄡ, ㄢ, ㄣ, ㄤ, ㄥ, ㄦ, ㄨ, ㄩ
- **Pinyin**: a, o, e, ê, ai, ei, ao, ou, an, en, ang, eng, er, i, u, ü

These are simple, easy-to-read sounds such as: ā, wō, ē, yē, āi, ēi, áo, ōu, ān, ēn, áng, ēng, ér, yī, wū, yū.

**The Eighteen Rhymes of China**

On October 10, 1941, the Republic of China’s National Government issued a list of eighteen rhymes. From the table, we can see that sixteen of these rhymes align with the sixteen basic rhymes outlined above.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3064-1.webp?w=640)</figure>The eighteen rhymes are formed from these sixteen basic rhymes plus other compound finals. Two additional rhymes are introduced: the five "ㄭ" sounds and the "十八东" (shí bā dōng) with the finals "ㄨㄥ" (wēng) and "ㄩㄥ" (yūng).

The "ㄭ" symbol (帀) was added in 1932 during a meeting to compile the _Guoyin Changyong Zihui_ (Commonly Used Chinese Pronunciation Dictionary) to make annotation easier.

This symbol serves as a placeholder for omitted finals (known as "zero finals" or "empty finals"), often used with sounds like "ㄓ" (zhī), "ㄔ" (chī), and others when they occur in isolation. The "十八东" refers to the compound finals "ong" (ㄨㄥ) and "iong" (ㄩㄥ), representing the "yong" sound.

**The New Chinese Rhyme System**

The _New Chinese Rhyme_ system was introduced by the China Poetry Association in May 2005 and consists of fourteen rhymes.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border">![](https://rips.rip/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_3065-1.webp?w=640)</figure>After understanding the previous eighteen rhymes, we can easily see how the New Rhymes differ.

The New Rhyme system combines the "three ge" rhymes into the "two bo" group, meaning that the finals "e" and "o" are considered the same. It also merges the "十八东" rhymes into the "十一庚" group, combining "eng" and "ong." Furthermore, the "六儿" (liu er) and "十一鱼" (shi yi yu) rhymes are merged into the "十二齐" group, with "i," "er," and "ü" now counted as the same rhyme.

After this consolidation, the New Rhyme system appears simpler and more streamlined. However, because many similar-sounding rhymes are now used interchangeably, there are fewer distinctions in terms of poetic form. This has led to a gradual divergence from traditional poetry. To truly master the art of classical poetry, one must understand these 16 basic rhymes, distinguish between the 21 compound finals, and pay attention to proper meter and rhythm in poetic composition. Without such attention to detail, it becomes increasingly difficult to produce poetry that adheres to traditional standards.
