诗人想写一首诗——  
浪人送花给他的情人。  
想情人身穿白色非加绒长裤，  
牛仔排扣，手捧鲜花，  
浪人站身旁。  
诗人写下了这首诗，  
送给他情人。

- Poet wants to write a poem —
- A ronin sends flowers to his lover.
- Want the lover wearing white non-fleece trousers,
- Denim buttons, holding flowers,
- Ronin stood beside.
- The poet wrote this poem,
- Sending it to his lover.
