灵魂伴侣，哪能平常日子里就闯进我们的世界？但是那人一到来，就注定变革我们的人生。不是说他十全十美，他与普通人长得毫无二致。他只是让你思考事物的本质，然后去改变糟糕的现况，完成其他人不曾陪你做到的事情。从此长久以往地住在你心里。

Soulmates, how can they break into our world on ordinary days? But when that person arrives, he is destined to change our lives. It’s not that he’s perfect, he looks no different from ordinary people. He just makes you think about the essence of things, and then change the bad situation, do things that others have never done with you. And live in your heart forever.
