梦见和陌生大姐去宾馆开房，进电梯被负责监控认识的人捉住，当场作罢；梦见父母和陌生人撕打，自己也加入扭转了战局；梦见和大学同学一起赶车；梦见有女生喜欢我，却不敢表白……

梦见科学家说不相信外星人存在，而选择是否就卫星继续发射进行争论，结果发射卫星招来了和我们同样肤色但是会飞的ta们，被定义为反动分子，全人类都合力起来围剿他们。虽然不是那么心甘情愿；那时我又梦见了鲁迅。

Dreaming of going to a hotel with a strange older sister, being caught by the person in charge of monitoring in the elevator, and stopping on the spot; dreaming of parents and strangers fighting, and joining in to reverse the situation; dreaming of catching a bus with college classmates; dreaming of a girl who likes me, but dare not confess…

Dreaming of scientists saying they don’t believe in the existence of aliens, and choosing whether to continue to argue about whether to continue launching satellites, as a result, launching satellites attracted those who have the same skin color as us but can fly, and were defined as reactionary elements, and all mankind joined forces to encircle and suppress them. Although not so willing; that time I dreamed of Lu Xun again.
