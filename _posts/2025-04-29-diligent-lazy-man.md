勤快的做法，用手分开做；比较勤快的做法，慌乱没有计划地安排多种工具；比较懒的做法，提前富有效率地使用单一工具；懒的替代做法，热水和钱，即时搞定一切。

“勤快的”，劳累自己身体；“比较的”，则劳累多种或单一工具；而“懒的”，单纯劳累脑子或金钱。

多种方法，对应适合各种不同类型的群体。

## Be the diligent lazy man

The _truly diligent_ use their own hands to handle everything manually. The _relatively diligent_ scramble with multiple tools, often without a clear plan. The _relatively lazy_ preemptively choose one efficient tool to save time and effort. The _truly lazy_ rely on hot water and money—solving everything instantly, with minimal effort.

“Diligent” means burdening the body; “Relatively” means burdening either multiple tools or a single one inefficiently; “Lazy,” however, simply burdens the mind—or the wallet.

Each approach corresponds to a different kind of person, each with their own rhythm of solving problems.
