以下内容纯属虚构，如有雷同、完全抄袭：

今天，我开枪把杀人犯打死。此刻，我内心没有一点波动。就在刚刚几分钟前，杀人犯用枪打死了我的家人。开枪的时候，我耳朵听不见其它任何声音，只看到亲人倒在血泊中，仿佛天塌了。趁杀人犯内心不稳，我抢夺了ta手里的枪。我开枪的时候，没有丝毫犹豫，内心只有兴奋之情。

我报仇了！是的，我不承认那是袭警。我无比坚信自己是正义的一方！即便现在，很多警察想要我死。我坦然接受。只是因为，我杀人了！而杀人，总是不对的……我该死！

在家中击毙“警察”或在家中被“警察”击毙，你会作何选择？击毙杀人犯的选择，总是最好的！

The following content is purely fictitious, and if there is any similarity, it is completely plagiarized:

Today, I shot a murderer to death. At this moment, there is no movement in my heart. Just a few minutes ago, the murderer shot my family dead. When shots fired, I couldn’t hear any other sounds, only to see my relative lying in a pool of blood, as if the sky had collapsed. Taking advantage of the murderer‘s instability, I snatched the gun from his hand. When I shot, there was no hesitation, only excitement in my heart.

I have my revenge! Yes, I don’t admit that it was Assaulting a police officer. I am very convinced that I am the just party! Even now, a lot of cops want me dead. I accept this calmly. Just because I killed someone! Killing is always wrong… I deserve to die!

Shot the “police” at home or was shot by the “police” at home, what would you choose? The choice to kill a murderer, is always the best!
