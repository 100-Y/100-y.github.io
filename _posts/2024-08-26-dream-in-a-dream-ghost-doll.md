一天，孙婆带着她的家人以及半岁小孩去爬山。小孩光着脚丫屁颠屁颠走在长满杂草的小道。我跟在小孩最后边。小孩要求抱抱，前面的其它孩子已经走很快，隔了有一段路程了。无奈，只好有我来，担负这个责任。

这便恰好成了后续梦中所有恐怖故事的源头。

抱在手里的半岁娃娃，不知怎的全身异常柔软，跟一泥鳅似的，更像一人头蛇身的妖怪，变换各种手位，终究来回缩动。走在前面的孙婆以及其ta比较大的孩子们，远处发现纷纷停下了脚步。其中，年龄比较大的一个孩子，指责我抱孩子的方式不对。当孩子交给ta手中，孩子又重新恢复了原样。然后，半岁小孩继续跟在了ta们身后。

事后，大家各自回到各自某个家里。夜晚，半岁小孩突然闯入我的梦境，好似白天夜间的小路，我欺负了ta一般。是要报复给我留下深刻不灭的印象。

先是小孩开始钻进我的被窝，趴在我身上，变成一滩粘长的物体。吓得我双脚双手，分别尝试蹬开和甩走沉重的被窝与附着的物体。当我又在尝试睁开眼睛的其它瞬间，发现鬼魅的眼睛在盯着我。我定了定神，看见自家的天花板，回到了真实世界。我舒了口气，急忙又重新睡了过去。当我再次睁眼，发现变成了其它鬼魅在眼睛直勾勾地盯着我。ta们没有眼睛，感觉比先前半岁光脚走在山野小道的娃娃，看起来还要恐怖。

我重新定了定神，尝试写下梦中的这一境遇。

One day, Sun Po brought her family along with her half-year-old child to climb a mountain. The child, barefoot, toddled along a path overgrown with weeds, bouncing along in a carefree manner. I followed behind, trailing last. The child requested to be carried, but the other children ahead had already walked quite a distance. With no other choice, it fell to me to take on that responsibility.

And so, this moment became the origin of all the terrifying stories that would haunt my dreams later.

The child in my arms, for reasons unknown, felt unusually limp—soft like a mudfish, almost like a creature with a human head and a serpent's body, shifting its position in my grasp, wriggling back and forth. The others in front, including Sun Po and the older children, noticed from a distance and stopped. One of the older children scolded me for holding the baby incorrectly. When the child was handed over to them, it returned to its usual form. Then, the half-year-old child continued to follow behind them.

Later, everyone returned to their respective homes. That night, the half-year-old child suddenly appeared in my dream, like the small road from the day, as if I had wronged it. It seemed to want to exact a deep, unshakable vengeance on me.

First, the child crawled into my bed, lying on top of me, transforming into a long, sticky mass. Terrified, I tried to kick and fling the heavy blanket and its attached weight off me. In another attempt to open my eyes, I saw a ghostly set of eyes staring at me. I steadied myself and found I was looking at my own ceiling, returning to the real world. I sighed in relief, quickly falling back asleep. But when I opened my eyes again, I found other ghostly figures staring at me with piercing, hollow eyes. They had no eyes, and somehow, they seemed even more terrifying than the half-year-old child who had toddled barefoot on the mountain trail.

I steadied myself once more, trying to write down the strange experience of this dream.
