向日葵花，窗台外面的向日葵花；  
透过窗台就能看见她。  
有且仅有三朵，没有枝干就那样突兀的插在地里；  
肆意欢笑地开着。  
那欢笑有魔力，  
使见着人的心情仿佛都沐浴在阳光中。

平白的生活，  
打一天突然闯出这么个开心的笑脸——  
莫名其妙，论是谁人路过遇见，  
都会开始担心起她的生活起来的吧。  
她会不会经由暴雨积水泡涨？  
烈日会不会使她灼伤？  
她会不会挨到八月底，撑过秋天；  
被冬天埋藏之后，春天再复苏过来？  
她会不会知道？  
窗台里也有人在看她。

说不在意，她也好像一点不介意，  
关心似路过看她的多半行人——  
少数则忍不住怀疑她是塑制品，  
纷纷猜她会活多久。  
还是她一直就没活过，突兀地插在地里，  
装样子而已？  
有人是相信，  
她没找着适当的机会表达。

愿葵花籽随时间快速地剥离、脱落，  
还没等园农伯伯发现就深藏土里；  
经受了向日葵花的滋养，  
隔年熬过生长付出代价，  
在众人的诧异声中活过来！  
适当地活过来。

也有人在梦里数花籽，  
在每天醒来小区某幢单元楼  
某侧的绿化带，  
透过窗台看她：  
愿爱继续，只是生命，  
换一种形式存活。

- Sunflower, the sunflower outside the windowsill;
- You can see her through the windowsill.
- There are only three of them, no branches, just stuck in the ground like that;
- Laughing wildly.
- That laughter has magic,
- Making people who see it feel as if they are bathed in sunlight.

- A plain life,
- Suddenly breaking out such a happy smile one day-
- For no reason, whoever passes by and meets her,
- Will start to worry about her life, right?
- Will she swell up from the rainwater?
- Will the scorching sun burn her?
- Will she make it to the end of August, survive the autumn;
- Be buried after winter, and revive in spring?
- Does she know?
- There are people watching her in the windowsill.

- Say you don’t care, she doesn’t seem to mind either,
- Caring like most of the passers-by who see her-
- A few can’t help but doubt that she is made of plastic,
- Guessing how long she will live.
- Or has she never lived, just stuck in the ground,
- Pretending?
- Some people believe,
- That she hasn’t found the right opportunity to express herself.

- May the sunflower seeds peel off and fall off quickly with time,
- Hide deep in the soil before the gardener uncle finds out;
- After being nourished by the sunflower,
- Survive the next year after paying the price of growth,
- And live on in the surprise of everyone!
- Live on properly.

- Some people also count the seeds in their dreams,
- And look at her through the windowsill every day
- When they wake up in a certain green belt on a certain side
- Of a certain unit building in the community:
- May love continue, only life,
- Survive in another form.
