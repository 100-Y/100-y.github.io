如果引导人们的新闻，一直是翻旧账，那么人的思维观念将永远是僵化的！七八年前是这样，现在是这样，将来还是一样！谈话、评论，鼓吹、传播；无知与盲目……没有一点点进步，毕生都在腐朽。

If the news that guides people is always digging up old accounts, then people’s thinking and concepts will always be rigid! It was like this seven or eight years ago, it is like this now, and it will be like this in the future! Talk, comment, tout, spread; ignorance and blindness… There is no progress at all, and they all are rotten for life.
