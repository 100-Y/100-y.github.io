中国：有着上下五千年悠久历史，是世界四大文明古国之一。

20世纪初1911年，辛亥革命爆发，第二年，亚洲第一个共和政体的民主共和国，中华民国诞生。宣告从公元前221年，秦始皇统一中国建立中央集权的统一多民族国家——秦朝，到最后的代表清朝，延续实行了2100多年的君主政体彻底退出历史舞台。

民国时期，中国内战不断，日本乘虚而入，日本投降，民国战败，到1949年10月1日，中国大陆中华人民共和国成立，采取“人民民主专政”的政权组织形式，实行“人民代表大会制度”的根本政治制度政体。这也宣告中国大陆的中华民国政体的实质性灭亡。中华民国残余势力，逃至中国台湾地区。

据中国大陆中华人民共和国《关于正确使用涉台宣传用语的意见》：对1949年10月1日之后的台湾地区政权，应称之为“台湾当局”或“台湾有关方面”、“台湾方面”，不使用“中华民国”，也一律不使用“中华民国”纪年。

中国不会亡：指的也是中国人不会亡。中国悠久的历史文化不会亡。但政党可以，代表中国的朝代可以：秦朝亡了，清朝亡了。代表中国2000多年的各个封建王朝都亡了。

党国、党国，有国才有党；国家、国家，有国才有家。人民、人民，没有人民就没有党国；人民、人民，没有人民就没有国家！

有中国，才有国民党和中华民国；有中国，才有共产党和中华人民共和国。中国大陆的中华民国没了，台湾地区的国民党还在……要中国没了，那就什么都没了！跳出国家政体和党派意识，才会更好地看待一个中国。

China: With a long history of more than 5,000 years, it is one of the four ancient civilizations in the world.

In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and the next year, the first republican democratic republic in Asia, the Republic of China, was born. It declared that from 221 BC, Qin Shihuang unified China and established a centralized multi-ethnic state – the Qin Dynasty, to the last representative Qing Dynasty, the monarchical system that lasted for more than 2100 years was completely withdrawn from the historical stage.

During the Republic of China period, China was in constant civil war, Japan took advantage of the situation and invaded, Japan surrendered, the Republic of China was defeated, and on October 1, 1949, the People’s Republic of China was established on the Chinese mainland, adopting the form of political organization of “people’s democratic dictatorship” and implementing the fundamental political system of “people’s congress system”. This also declared the substantial demise of the Republic of China regime on the Chinese mainland. The remnants of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan.

According to the Opinion on Correctly Using Taiwan-related Propaganda Terms by the People’s Republic of China on the Chinese mainland: For the Taiwan region regime after October 1, 1949, it should be called “Taiwan authorities” or “Taiwan-related parties” or “Taiwan side”, not using “Republic of China”, and not using “Republic of China” calendar.

China will not perish: it also means that the Chinese people will not perish. China’s long history and culture will not perish. But political parties can, the dynasties representing China can: Qin Dynasty perished, Qing Dynasty perished. All the feudal dynasties representing China for more than 2000 years have perished.

Party and state, party and state, there is a party only if there is a state; state and family, state and family, there is a family only if there is a state. People, people, there is no party and state without people; people, people, there is no state and family without people!

There is China, there is Kuomintang and Republic of China; there is China, there is Communist Party and People’s Republic of China. The Republic of China on the Chinese mainland is gone, but the Kuomintang in Taiwan is still there… If China is gone, then everything is gone! Only by jumping out of the national system and party consciousness can we better look at one China.
