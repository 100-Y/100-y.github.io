从偷盗贩卖的尸体，到无偿捐献的同种骨植入材料。从殡仪馆，到医药公司，到医院；从员工，医药代表，再到医生。相关的每个人，背地里都实实在在披着恶魔的皮，却在阳光下行使着神圣的职责。

别说改革开放后，为了利益才有这样的事情，改革开放前，大把人吃人的案例只是为了继续生存。如果说改革开放后是封建社会，那么改革开放前就是彻彻底底的原始森林。

恶不会消失，就像“四十年的改革开放”，解决了大部分人的生存问题，而对于人性深层次的探讨改善，“恶悄无声息学会了隐藏和转移。”

From stolen and trafficked corpses to the free donation of bone grafts of the same species. From funeral homes to pharmaceutical companies to hospitals; from employees and pharmaceutical representatives to doctors. Every person involved, behind the scenes, is cloaked in the skin of a demon, yet under the sun, they carry out sacred duties.

Don’t say that such things only emerged after the reform and opening-up for the sake of profit; before that, there were numerous cases of cannibalism, driven solely by the need to survive. If the period after the reform and opening-up was a feudal society, then the time before it was an utterly primitive forest.

Evil doesn’t disappear. Just like the "forty years of reform and opening-up" that solved the survival problems of most people, but when it comes to the deeper exploration and improvement of human nature, "evil has quietly learned how to hide and shift."
