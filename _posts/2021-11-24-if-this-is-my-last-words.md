正因为现实残酷，才会有很多的人仰望星空、归隐山林，或是遁入空门、坠入“地狱”。房子，一些物质的东西，对某些人而言，根本没有任何意义。任何事物都是没有意义的啊！

有人睡大街、居厕所；有人住高楼、多栋“高楼”。对一些人而言，有睡的地方、吃的东西，能够活着就行了；而我却想“造反”，改天换地、变革思想，重新分配一切。

所以，理想主义者——先驱，总是走“极端”。世界怎么可能不会，没有压迫和不公？我做不到，即使豁出无数条命。于是，我期盼人类灭绝。真心地。若这就是我的遗言。

Because of the reality is cruel, there will be many people look up at starry sky, retire to Mountains and Forests, or escape into Buddhism, fall into “Hell”. House, some material thing, for some people, has no meaning at all. Anything is meaningless ah!

Some people sleep on street, stay in toilet; some people live in high-rise buildings, multiple “high-rise buildings”. For some people, have a place to sleep, have a meal to eat, be able to live is enough; while I want to “Rebel”, change the world, change the mind, redistribute everything.

So, idealist-pioneer, always go “extreme”. The world how could won’t be, without oppression and injustice? I couldn’t do it, even at the cost of countless lives. So, I look forward to the extinction of human beings. Sincerely. If this is my last words.
