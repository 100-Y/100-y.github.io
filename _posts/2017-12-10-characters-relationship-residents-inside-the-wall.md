**怛、王国居民、城墙守卫军、各部落族群等**

海城墙战役过去后的几十年时间，一个繁荣壮大的墙内王国诞生了。王国里，君主和他善良、可爱的妻子，辛勤耕耘着他们的土地。宛若，母系社会的美好生活。但是王城四周仍有许多大小、善恶不一的部落族群。国王，誓要征服、并统一他们，给未来的人们，创造出和平美好年代。

在海神被薨王击败以后，海城墙落入了邪恶黑暗势力怛的手中。薨，在征服海城墙之南的各部途中，与王国北方族群缔结了婚约，有了他第一个“人类”儿子，怛。后来，薨回到他最初的领地；随着时间流逝，怛，逐渐成为海城墙权利最高的一方君主。

同时，随着海城墙的失守，海神（Ocean）的女儿，希雅，被薨囚禁关押于海城墙某个隐秘的牢狱之中。马修和城墙守卫士兵，曾多次想方设法营救，但都未有建树。直到最近一次惊险的营救行动，然而最终，却将战火蔓延到了新的人类王国。时值王国北方族群，已经加入邪恶薨、怛的阵营。迷蒙森林，也抵挡不住他们前行的脚步。

经过惨烈的王国战役，马修、城墙守卫军们和一并战斗的王国居民，承受了巨大损失。希雅，被再次俘虏；王国君主，留下他善良、可爱的妻儿，匆匆离世。马修的尸体，也一并与国王安葬在一起，于迷蒙森林之中。

只剩下一些残存的城墙守卫将士们，带着宝贵物件，逃亡不知所踪的南方海洋。过着鲜为人知的避世生活。最后，逐渐长大的王子，期待重现王国的繁荣。

**Da, the Kingdom Residents, the Wall Guard Army, Various Tribal Groups, etc.**

In the decades after the Sea Wall battle, a prosperous and powerful kingdom was born inside the wall. In the kingdom, the monarch and his kind and lovely wife worked hard on their land. It was like a beautiful life in a matriarchal society. But there are still many large and small, good and evil tribal groups around the king city. The king vowed to conquer and unify them, and create a peaceful and beautiful era for future generations.

After the Ocean God was defeated by King Hong, the Sea Wall fell into the hands of Da, an evil dark force. Hong, on his way to conquer the various tribes south of the Sea Wall, married a northern tribe of the Kingdom and had his first “human” son, Da. Later, Hong returned to his original territory; as time passed, Da gradually became the supreme lord of the Sea Wall.

At the same time, after the fall of the Sea Wall, the daughter of the Ocean God, Sea, was imprisoned in a secret prison inside the Sea Wall. Matthew and the wall guard soldiers tried many ways to rescue her, but they did not succeed. Until the recent thrilling rescue operation, but in the end, it spread the war to the new human kingdom. At this time, the northern tribes of the Kingdom had already joined the evil Hong and Da’s camp. The misty forest could not stop their footsteps.

After a fierce battle in the Kingdom, Matthew, the wall guard army and the Kingdom residents who fought with them suffered huge losses. Sea was captured again; the Kingdom monarch left his kind and lovely wife and son and died hastily. Matthew’s body was also buried with the king in the misty forest.

Only a few remaining wall guard soldiers escaped with valuable items to the unknown southern ocean. They lived a secluded life that few people knew about. Finally, the prince who grew up gradually hoped to restore the prosperity of the Kingdom.
