校园里，有人徒手，在艰难地攀爬。一层又一层的阶梯。顾不及拉上快隐约掉落的裤子。旁边一侧寝室的学生，不理解，有些充满着鄙视；有些说着什么，好奇看ta接下来的行动。

阶梯上面，是一个小的山坡。阶梯本是用脚来走的，他手腿并用。山坡上藤蔓杂生。

（终于，那人爬山阶梯，像留心到什么。）牵引山上的藤条，开始从山的一侧往路的一树，延伸。闲言碎语，听了心里免不了五味杂陈，即便这样，他不顾各的，仍旧继续摆弄他身边、手里的藤条。

只见他卖力的拉着藤条，从地面到空中，穿过纷乱，悬挂枝丫。白天，秋的落叶，随着牵引，一团在空中来回地飘荡；夜晚，夏的星星，闪转腾挪，几颗照亮他一人的星空。

他躺在空地上，仿佛睡着了。醒来，继续编织。他爬上终点的树，想将藤蔓打结、套牢。尝试数次，需要有人帮忙。心心念念树下来了俩，树样高的学生，接过结两头，使劲拉。连藤蔓、连他的脚，一同和树紧紧绑了起来。（那人后空翻，轻巧就解脱双腿……）

学生们纷纷竖起大拇指，口口相传编织彩虹的人。

In the campus, someone is climbing with bare hands, struggling. One layer after another of stairs. He doesn’t care to pull up his pants that are about to fall off. The students in the dormitory next to him don’t understand, some are full of contempt; some are saying something, curious to see his next move.

Above the stairs, there is a small hill. The stairs are meant to be walked with feet, but he uses his hands and legs. There are vines growing on the hill.

(Finally, the person climbing the stairs seems to notice something.) He pulls the vines from the hill and starts to extend them from one side of the mountain to a tree on the side of the road. Idle talk, listening to it makes him feel mixed emotions, but even so, he doesn’t care about others and continues to fiddle with the vines around him and in his hands.

Just saw him pulling hard on the vines, from the ground to the air, through the chaos, hanging branches. In the daytime, the autumn leaves, following the pull, flutter back and forth in the air; at night, the summer stars, twinkling and moving, a few illuminate his own starry sky.

He lay on the ground, as if asleep. He woke up and continued weaving. He climbed up to the end of the tree, trying to tie and secure the vines. He tried several times, but needed someone to help. He wished for two people to come down from under the tree, students as tall as trees, who took over both ends of the knot and pulled hard. The vines and his feet were tied tightly together with the tree. (He did a backflip and easily freed his legs…)

The students gave him thumbs up, spreading word of mouth about the man who weaves rainbows.
