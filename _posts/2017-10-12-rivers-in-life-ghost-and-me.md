生命中的河流，密密麻麻，挤满了各式各样的人形动物肢体；  
无知的人们以为是珍奇鱼类，纷纷将他们打捞上岸。  
有的已“死”去多时，有的还在拼命挣扎着跳入水中；  
我一边阻挠这“愚蠢”行为，一边发现岸边浮沉一颗眨眼的少女头颅……

我走近，万分惊恐，尝试用简短的英文与她交谈：  
她说她来自日本，错过了这次赶胎时间；  
以半人形模样委身鱼类，而再次苟活人间。  
可我疑问“你却来到中国的河流？“  
她又说：下次新生时间在123天以后，之前，她务必赶往所到之处。  
我又无知了！决定帮助她完成这一艰难使程……

于是、忽然。她冰凉的身体，伸出一支手来，  
搭在我左边胳膊的窝心处：  
这一直接行为，吓得我慌乱，差点坠入那该死的河中……  
我想我是要被鬼迷心窍，然后，我醒了！

- Rivers in life, densely, packed with all kinds of humanoid animal limbs;
- Ignorant people think they are rare fishes, and salvaging them ashore one after another.
- Some have been “dead” for a long time, some are still struggling desperately to jump into the water;
- On the one hand, i was trying to obstruct this “stupid” behavior, at the same time, i found a blinking young girl’s head floating and sinking on the shore…

- As i approached, i was terrified, trying to talk to her in short english:
- She say she is from japan, missed the delivery time;
- Turn into a fish in half-human form. and live the world again.
- But i doubt “why you come to the river of china?”
- She added: the next newborn time is 123 days later, before that, she must rush wherever she goes.
- I’m ignorant again! deciding to help her complete this difficult journey…

- So, all of a sudden. her cold body stretched out a hand,
- Put it on the center of my left arm:
- This direct behavior scared me into a panic. almost fell into the damn river…
- I think i’m going to be fascinated by ghosts, then i woke up!
