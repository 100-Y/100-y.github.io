在意义的雾中，符号如裂镜，映出凝视者的欲望与惧怕。它不再中性，而是被光影涂抹成旗帜、刀锋。叙事由目光完成，观看成了编码，转发成了立场，符号沦为情绪的兵器。

我们不再理解，而在投射；不再讲述，而在塑造。意义如流沙，在点击中重构与极化。真正的自由，不是选择故事，而是察觉——我们早已被置于叙事之中。

In the fog of meaning, symbols fracture like mirrors, reflecting the desires and fears of the one who gazes. They are no longer silent, smeared with light and shadow, they become banners, become blades. Narrative is no longer told, but seen, to watch is to encode, to share is to choose a side, symbols degrade into weapons of emotion.

We are not understanding, we are projecting; we are not narrating, we are sculpting. Meaning slips like sand, reconfigured and polarized with each click. True freedom lies not in choosing a story, but in realizing—we were always already inside one.
