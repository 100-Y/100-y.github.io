极左：赞美不彻底，彻底不赞美。“唯一”指导方针。  
左派：赞美是最重要的工作。  
右倾的左派：赞美是主要工作，适当批评。  
中间派：该赞美赞美、该批评批评（理想情况）；夹着尾巴做人（现实处境）。  
左倾的右派：批评是主要工作，适当赞美。  
右派：批评是最重要的工作。  
极右：批评不彻底，彻底不批评。“造反”唯一成功道路。

极左等于极右，“唯一”指导方针等于“造反”唯一成功道路。

中国历史上去找“极右极左”集大成者的典型代表，绕不开“嬴政、刘邦、朱元璋、毛泽东”这几个名字。除了以上这类，有严重人格和心理方面问题的“天才疾病选手”，以及“岁静的中间派”，其它也都或多或少，“被逼着”患上了不同程度精神方面的疾病。

而，世间本没有左右、中间，没有派别，人也应当没有尾巴。夹着尾巴做人，那不一样还是猴子么！

Extreme Left: Incomplete praise, thoroughly incomplete praise. The "only" guiding principle. Left-wing: Praise is the most important task. Right-leaning Left-wing: Praise is the primary task, with appropriate criticism.

Centrist: Praise when it’s due, criticize when it’s due (ideal situation); live with your tail between your legs (realistic situation).

Left-leaning Right-wing: Criticism is the primary task, with appropriate praise. Right-wing: Criticism is the most important task. Extreme Right: Incomplete criticism, thoroughly incomplete criticism. "Rebellion" is the only successful path.

Extreme Left = Extreme Right, "only" guiding principle = "Rebellion" is the only successful path.

In Chinese history, if we were to search for typical representatives of "extreme right and extreme left," the names "Ying Zheng (Qin Shi Huang), Liu Bang, Zhu Yuanzhang, Mao Zedong" cannot be overlooked. Apart from these, there are also those "genius figures" with serious personality and psychological issues, as well as "passive centrists." Everyone else has, to a greater or lesser degree, been "forced" into various degrees of mental illness.

In reality, there is no such thing as left, right, or center; no factions. People should not have tails. To live with one’s tail between their legs, isn’t that just like a monkey?
