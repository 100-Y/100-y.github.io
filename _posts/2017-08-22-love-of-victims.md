天空划过一片黑色云彩，那是苦难人正在经历的爱情。  
一如懦弱少年，飞蛾扑火，  
也曾义无反顾，炙热死亡。  
大地流泪，罪恶瞬间开始冲刷……

有人说，痛彻心扉是灵魂深处在悲鸣，  
伤及骨髓，整个部位才会麻木不仁。  
一如高位截肢的病人，感觉不到双腿；  
全身麻痹的手术患者，掌握不了生死。  
又如等雨的人，重新收拾，准备好回家行囊；  
避雨的鸟儿，甩干潮湿羽毛，会再次飞翔。

天有放晴的时候，太阳总会出来；  
然后污秽，等待、沉淀、被埋入深底……  
真爱你的人从不让你一直伤心，一轮接着一轮！  
不要太赞，苦难的人会哭。

- A black cloud crossed the sky, that’s the love that people in distress are experiencing.
- Like a weak teenager, a moth to the flame,
- Once went forward without hesitation, burning to death.
- The earth wept, and sin began to wash away in an instant…

- Some say that heartache is a deep cry from the soul,
- Hurt to the bone, only the whole part is numbness.
- Like a patient who has had a high amputation, unable to feel his legs;
- Surgical patients with paralysis all over their bodies cannot grasp life and death.
- And like those waiting for rain, they pack up and prepare to go home;
- Birds that avoid rain shake off their wet feathers and will fly again.

- There are times when the sky clears, and the sun always comes out;
- Then it becomes filthy, waiting, precipitating, and buried deep…
- Those who truly love you will not let you be sad all the time, one round after another!
- Don’t praise too much, people in distress will cry.
