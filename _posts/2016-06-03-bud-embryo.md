小时候，人们都叫我美芽胚子，  
说等着看我长大后的样子。  
时间慢慢过去，我逐渐长大，  
他们也老了。  
不知什么时候开始，  
我讨厌现在长成汉子的自己，  
势利、偏激，  
盲目与毫无所从。  
于是乎经常怀念以前的日子：  
那时我还是美芽，无忧无虑的胚子……  
长大更多的事，其实并不一无是处，  
我开始懂得小时候根本无法理解懂得的事情。  
只是没来及看他们年轻时候模样，  
我就长大了。

- When i was a child, people used to call me beautiful bud-embryo,
- Said to wait and see what i will look like when i grow up.
- As time goes by, i grow up,
- And they get old.
- I don’t know when to start,
- I hate myself like a man now.
- Snobbish, extreme,
- Blind and commonplace.
- So i often miss the old days:
- At that time, i was still a beautiful bud, a carefree embryo…
- Growing up more things, is actually not useless,
- I start to understand the things that i couldn’t understand when i was a child.
- I just didn’t come to see what they looked like when they were young.
- I grew up.
