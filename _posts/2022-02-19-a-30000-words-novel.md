记得还是初中的时候，写了篇差不多3万字左右的小说。讲梦，讲黑暗，讲勇气，讲光明。有池塘、河流、洞窟、怪物，有小伙伴。夹放在不知道的哪本书里，高中毕业，把家里翻了个底朝天，都没找到。

时至今日，都觉得很是遗憾的一件事情。有些珍贵的东西，比如“草稿”，一定要保存好。或许根本就没写过，全都在梦里。

I remember it was in junior high school, I wrote a novel of about 30,000 words. It was about dreams, darkness, courage, and light. There were ponds, rivers, caves, monsters, and friends. It was sandwiched in a book that I didn’t know where, and when I graduated from high school, I turned the house upside down and didn’t find it.

To this day, I still feel it’s a pity. Some precious things, such as “drafts”, must be kept well. Maybe I never wrote it at all, it was all in my dreams.
