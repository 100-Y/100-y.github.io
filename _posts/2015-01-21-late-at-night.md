夜半三更，  
肝火旺止，倦意深浓。  
床不觉压抑，目不蔽心不累。  
独处，久已成疾。  
不待人爱爱自己，  
药方好，自言语。

- Late at night,
- Liver fire ceases to blaze, weariness sets deep.
- Bed feels submissive, eyes unshielded, heart delightful.
- Solitude, has long become an ailment.
- Without waiting for others' love, love oneself,
- Prescription is good, self-talk is evidence.
