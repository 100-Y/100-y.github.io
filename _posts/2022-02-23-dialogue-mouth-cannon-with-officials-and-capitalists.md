抢占ta们信仰、道德的至高点

## 嘴炮与官员

您是人民么？  
您的信仰是什么？  
您为谁服务？  
您不是人民，那么您是谁？  
您是境外势力派来祸害母国人民的反动派么？  
难道您不为人民服务，是为资本家？

## 嘴炮与资本家

您是人民么？  
您有道德底线么？  
您也敢这么大张旗鼓地搞剥削，在社会主义国家？  
您不是人民，那么您是黄世仁？  
您就不怕官员，杀您的头、抄您的家么？  
难道您的保护伞，就是官员？

Occupying the highest point of their faith, morality

## Mouth cannon and officials

```
Are you the people?
What is your faith?
Who do you serve?
You are not the people, then who are you?
Are you a reactionary sent by foreign forces to harm the people of your motherland?
Don’t you serve the people, but the capitalists?
```

## Mouth cannon and capitalists

Are you the people?  
Do you have a moral bottom line?  
How dare you exploit so openly in a socialist country?  
You are not the people, then are you Huang Shiren?  
Are you not afraid of the officials, killing your head, ransacking your home?  
Is your umbrella, the official?
