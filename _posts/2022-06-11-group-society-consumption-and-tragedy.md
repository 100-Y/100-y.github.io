世界本没有错，单一个体也没有；错的是，ta们构成的群体。群体社会：无限内耗，又或者，需要转移某种影响。于是注定了，每天都有悲剧事件产生。

There is nothing wrong with the world, nor with an individual; what is wrong is the group they form. Group society: infinite consumption, or the need to transfer some kind of influence. As a result, tragedies are bound to happen every day.
