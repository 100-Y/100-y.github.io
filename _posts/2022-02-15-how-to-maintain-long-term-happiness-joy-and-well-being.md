因为周围环境，遇到的人、事；因为逐渐“长大”；因为别人家的孩子，因为自家亲人……

因为唯物学说：讲物质，不以“人类”、“自己”的意志，而“转移”。所以，人类生来，是要受罪的。受自己、受物质的罪。唯物论，像是“人类”提出，打压、欺骗自己的工具和惩罚，像是给自己安上的，“阿喀琉斯之踵”。

因为唯心学说：讲世界不是谁的，是你“自己”。每当物质供需、社会矛盾，出现巨大问题。人类，又打着“宗教”和“信仰”的旗帜，“拯救”自己、屡试不爽。唯心论，成了双刃剑，成了救命稻草。

因为自己…

不讲“唯心、唯物”，不讲“意识、形态”……讲一个人寿命的，周期。讲生、死。讲“自己”。讲长久地幸福、快乐，安康！

和刚出生的自己，每前一个阶段的自己，相比。

**注**：自己：人类自己，不是“自己”的自己。“人类”、“自己”：泛指“意识”。

Because of the surrounding environment, the people and things encountered; because of gradually “growing up”; because of other people’s children, because of own relatives…

Because of materialism: it talks about matter, not the will of “human beings” or “self”, to “transfers”. Therefore, human beings are born to suffer. Suffer from self, suffer from matter. Materialism, like a tool and punishment that “human beings” propose to suppress and deceive themselves, like a “Achilles’ heel” that they put on themselves.

Because of idealism: it says that the world does not belong to anyone, but to “self”. Whenever there are huge problems in material supply and demand, social contradictions. Human beings, under the banner of “religion” and “faith”, “save” themselves and never fail. Idealism becomes a double-edged sword, a lifesaving straw.

Because of self…

Don’t talk about “idealism or materialism”, don’t talk about “consciousness or form”… Talk about the cycle of a person’s life span. Talk about life and death. Talk about “self”. Talk about long-term happiness, joy, and well-being!

Compared with self when it was just born, and self at every previous stage.

**Note**: Self: human beings themselves, not “self” themselves. “Human beings” and “self”: generally refer to “consciousness”.
