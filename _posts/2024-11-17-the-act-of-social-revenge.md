报复社会的行为往往源于极端的心理扭曲和情绪积压。选择无辜的路人而非直接报复加害者，反映出几种深层次的心理动因：

**失控感与虚假权力的重建**：报复者通常视加害者为强大存在，自己却感到无力反抗。无力感转化为对社会的广泛不满，攻击无辜路人，仿佛通过伤害他人来重新找回控制感。路人不是真正的目标，他们只是社会的不满情绪的象征。

**普遍化的仇恨**：报复者将个人的痛苦投射到整个社会，他们认为不公并非源自单一的加害者，而是社会整体的冷漠与压迫。因此，攻击无辜者成为一种“惩罚”社会的方式。

**心理安全与逃避现实**：与加害者对抗可能需要面对道德冲突、法律后果和失败的风险。而针对无辜者，目标不明确且无防备，较容易实施。这种“低风险、高效能”的方式能迅速释放情绪，避免面对复仇过程的复杂性。

**匿名性与认同缺失**：报复者通常感到与社会孤立，缺乏情感联结。他们视无辜者为工具，而不再区分“罪与非罪”。这种失去认同感的状态让他们的攻击变得更加盲目和广泛。

**深层痛苦的传递**：在心理层面，受害者有时试图通过让他人感受自己的痛苦来求得心理平衡。无法从加害者那里获得满足感后，他们将痛苦转移到无辜者身上，以此填补内心的空虚。

总结而言，报复者选择无辜路人，是其内心矛盾和认知扭曲的表现。这种行为体现了他们既渴望力量与关注，又回避面对复杂问题的冲突。无论动机如何复杂，最终都会带来无法挽回的伤害。为了应对这种行为，我们不仅需要法律的制约，更要关注社会边缘群体的心理需求，避免情绪爆发之前对他们的忽视。这也许是预防无辜受害的关键。

The act of social revenge often stems from extreme psychological distortions and accumulated emotions. Choosing innocent bystanders instead of directly targeting the perpetrators reflects several underlying psychological motives:

**Loss of Control and the Rebuilding of False Power**: The perpetrators often perceive their oppressors as powerful figures, feeling powerless in confronting them. This sense of helplessness transforms into widespread discontent with society, and they attack innocent bystanders as a way to regain a sense of control. The bystanders are not the real target; they serve as a symbol of the societal frustration.

**Generalized Hatred**: The revenge-seekers project their personal pain onto society as a whole. They believe their suffering is not caused by a specific individual but by the overall indifference and oppression of society. Therefore, attacking innocent people becomes a way to "punish" society.

**Psychological Safety and Avoidance of Reality**: Confronting the perpetrators directly may involve moral conflicts, legal consequences, and the risk of failure. In contrast, attacking innocent bystanders, whose identity is not specific and who are unprotected, is easier to carry out. This "low-risk, high-efficiency" choice allows them to quickly release their emotions without dealing with the complexity of real revenge.

**Anonymity and Loss of Identity**: Revenge-seekers often feel isolated from society and lack emotional connections with others. They view innocent people as mere instruments rather than distinguishing between the "guilty" and the "innocent." This loss of identity leads them to act blindly and indiscriminately.

**Transference of Deep Pain**: On a psychological level, victims sometimes seek to achieve balance by making others experience their pain. Unable to derive satisfaction from confronting the perpetrator, they direct their suffering towards innocent people to fill the emptiness within.

In summary, the choice to attack innocent bystanders is a manifestation of deep psychological contradictions and cognitive distortions. This behavior reflects their desire for power and attention while simultaneously avoiding the complexity of confronting the actual issues. Regardless of their complex motivations, such actions ultimately result in irreparable harm. To address this behavior, we need not only legal constraints but also a societal focus on the psychological needs of marginalized groups, preventing the neglect of these individuals before their emotions erupt. This may be the key to preventing further innocent victims.
