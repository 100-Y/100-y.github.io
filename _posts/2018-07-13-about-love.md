一段感情，经历过后，最害怕的不是两个人没在一起；而是身处漩涡中的两人，没有获得成长。成长了，那么这段感情经历的双方，无论怎样，最后都不要觉得后悔！因为经历了各自的高兴，也经历了彼此所带来的悲伤。

转而学会将剩下的“不济”，看成是圆满之前的结局。尽管结局多时不会圆满……但也并不就意味，可以将这借口，拿来作为不真心去爱、努力付出的理由。

或许，身处漩涡中的两人还未有绝论。也要彼此感谢对方呀！谢谢对方教会自己成长，使自己看到了性格上的缺点。谢谢彼此带来快乐、高兴，乃至悲伤。让人觉得爱情真的是件无比美好的东西。

而，这样真诚的人们，也要自觉自己是幸福的啊！当我们忘掉所有不愉快的经历，只把美好记忆都留存时，爱情就已经到来了！

A relationship, after going through it, the most afraid thing is not that the two people are not together; but the two people in the whirlpool, did not get growth. If they grow up, then both sides of this relationship experience, no matter what, don’t feel regretful in the end! Because they have experienced their own happiness, and also experienced the sadness brought by each other.

Instead, learn to see the remaining “not good” as the ending before perfection. Although the ending is often not perfect… but it does not mean that one can use this as an excuse to not love sincerely and work hard.

Perhaps, the two people in the whirlpool have not yet reached a conclusion. They should also thank each other! Thank you for each other teaching to grow up and see each shortcomings in personality. Thank you for bringing happiness, joy, and even sadness. It makes people feel that love is really a very beautiful thing.

And, such sincere people, should also be aware that they are happy! When we forget all the unpleasant experiences and only keep the beautiful memories, love has arrived!
