如果生命有意义，那么苦难也一定有。苦难是生命不可踢出的一部分，就像命运和死亡一样。没有苦难和死亡，人的生命便不完整。

对死亡进行研究，是解脱生命的关键。

死亡，赋予生命以意义，赋予时间以价值。如果时间太多，生命就会变得毫无意义。

有的人，穷尽一生想给生命和死亡赋予新的含义，把自己头脑推向崩溃的边缘，最后创造出一个伟大思想或作品，却发现它毫无意义。

我的朋友，我的家人。如果我可以用我的余生，带领他们中的一些，进入他们死亡的境地，我是决不会做的。眼睁睁看着一个未受过死亡训练的人，面对自己的死亡，那是一种折磨。

关于死亡的记录，从本质上讲，也是关于生存的记录。这是所有记录中都有的东西。

对作者来说，在书中留下自己死亡的痕迹，具有重大意义。

人类出生的目的，是获得灵魂的解脱。死亡，只是其中的一条真理。

未即当下！活着就是在死亡！

If life has meaning, then suffering must also have. Suffering is an inseparable part of life, just like fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life would be incomplete.

Studying death is the key to liberating life.

Death, gives meaning to life, gives value to time. If there is too much time, life would become meaningless.

Some people spend their whole lives trying to give new meaning to life and death, pushing their minds to the brink of collapse, and finally creating a great thought or work, only to find it meaningless.

My friends, my family. If I could use the rest of my life, to lead some of them, into the realm of their death, I would never do it. It is a torture to watch someone who has not been trained in death, face their own death.

Records of death are, essentially, also records of survival. This is something that all records have.

For the author, leaving traces of his own death in the book has great significance.

The purpose of human birth is to obtain the liberation of the soul. Death is just one of the truths.

Future is now! To live is to die!
