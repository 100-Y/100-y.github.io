她披着凤求凰，她身着紫金衣；  
她脚踏般若琉璃心樽，她裹携五彩斑斓裙带。  
他放牛雨天外，他养鸭竹林旁；  
他采菇山巅处，他捕鱼溪流前。

她来到他梦里。  
见他一见钟情，见他驻足停留；  
见他身无分文，见他穷苦不堪。  
见他日夜沉沦劳作，见他日夜潦倒不思；  
她醒了！

他来到她梦里。  
见她一见钟情，见她驻足停留；  
见她身无分文，见她穷苦不堪。  
见她日夜劳作不思，见她日夜潦倒沉沦。  
他醒了！

- She wears phoenix clothes, and purple gold garments;
- She steps on the vajra glass heart cup, and carries a colorful skirt.
- He grazes cattle outside in rainy days, and raises ducks beside the bamboo forest;
- He picks mushrooms at the top of the mountain, and catches fish in front of the stream.

- She came into his dream.
- Fell in love at first sight, stopped and stayed;
- That he had no money, that he was poor and miserable.
- That he worked hard day and night, that he was down and out day and night.
- She woke up!
