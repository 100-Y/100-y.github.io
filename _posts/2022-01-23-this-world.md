这个世界，虚伪且丑陋。每一个人，都有能力，帮助ta人；每一个人，都有需要被帮助的地方。这个世界，很美好。很少有人需要帮助；很少有人会主动帮助ta人。这个世界，首先是ta自己；然后才是“你我ta”。这是个可以改变的世界；你我ta，也都可以。

This world is hypocritical and ugly. Everyone has the ability to help others; everyone has areas where they need help. This world is very beautiful. Few people need help; few people will actively help others. This world is first of all itself; then it is “you, me, and others”. This is a world that can be changed; you, me, and others can also do it.
