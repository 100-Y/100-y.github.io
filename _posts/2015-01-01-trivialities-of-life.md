窗外安装来摆放盆景的铁架子。一楼的塑料棚子，二楼上面一直不停落下滴着的水珠。凉完衣服忘关水龙头以及隔壁倒头就睡彻夜鼾声的“猪”。实在都无可救药：生命很贱，人心很蛊。

The iron rack outside the window for placing potted plants. The plastic shed on the first floor, the water droplets that keep falling from the second floor. The faucet that forgets to turn off after drying the clothes, and the “pig” next door who falls asleep and snores all night. Are really hopeless: life is cheap, and people’s hearts are bewitched.
