那里周围，方圆十里，  
都弥漫着腐臭的死亡气息。  
饥饿的老鸹啃食藤蔓上的蛆虫，  
鹫鹰盘旋在“沼泽之地”上空……  
等待喂饱它们的将是一国同胞，  
被惨无人道屠戮的王国士兵、人民。  
生前为了保卫国、家，  
死后身体还不能及时掩埋……

王城之战伊始，收尸人就跑得毫无踪影。  
途经墓地，王后之行稍作停留：  
“国王他，怕是回生乏术；这里是可以成为妥善安葬的最后场所了！”  
于是，深陷恐惧迷惘的妻子，剩下不多气息的配偶尝试安慰她：  
“我敬爱的王后，照顾好我们的儿子，活下去！  
与一同抛洒热血的子民深埋自己国家王土，会是件多么幸运的美事！  
还有马修，我最亲密无间的好友，  
好生料理他的后事。”

（讲完）

“生前不能看我儿长大，与王国复兴；临死了，愿天地正义长存，善恶有报。以他父亲王国的名义存誓！”（墓志铭）

（溃败撤退之时，为避免黑暗势力的扫荡、侦察，王后决定将马修的遗体秘密安排。于“沼泽之地”封存。）

There, ten miles ground,  
Around with a smell of rotten-death.  
Hungry-old crows gnaw maggots on vines,  
While the vultures wheeling over “Swampy Land”…  
Waiting to feed them will be the compatriots of country,  
The soldiers and people of the kingdom have been brutally slaughtered.  
In order to defend the country and the family,  
The body can not be buried in time after death…

At the beginning of the Battle of the Kingdom, the body collectors ran without a trace.  
Passing through the graveyard, the queen stopped for a while:  
“The king, I’m afraid he doesn’t have the skills to bring back life; this is the last place for a proper burial!”  
So, the wife who is deeply fearful and perplexed and the spouse who is left with little breath tries to comfort her:  
“My beloved queen, take good care of our son and live on!  
How lucky it would be to bury the kingdom of our country with the people who sprinkled their blood together!  
And Matthew, my closest friend,  
Take good care of his affairs.”

(End)

“When I was alive, I couldn’t watch my son grow up and revive the kingdom; On the verge of death, may justice in heaven and earth last forever, and good and evil will be rewarded. Swear in the name of his father’s kingdom!”(Epitaph)

(During the rout and retreat, in order to avoid the sweeping and reconnaissance of the dark forces, the Queen decided to make a secret arrangement for Matthew’s body. Sealed in “Swampy Land”.)
