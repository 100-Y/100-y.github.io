“凡使人不再吞咽者，皆为药神中的洛基。”

从出生那一口奶开始，到衰老那一口饭，人类始终在以“吃”来证明“我还活着”。进食，是生命与世界最原初的契约，是个体对存在最直观的确认。剥夺进食，就是切断了人与世界最原始的连接。

药物本应是协助生的工具，却假借“拯救”的名义，剥夺病人“进食”的能力，在衰微之际加速其系统崩塌。它切断的，不只是生理的功能，更是意志的根部。在极端情况下，这甚至变成了一种带有技术暴力色彩的“医疗杀人”。

不是刀、不是枪，是一片毫无温度的药丸，它无声、不流血，却让人慢慢无法进食、虚弱、器官衰竭，直至死亡。

真正可怖的，并非死亡本身，而是生的尊严，早已被抽空。这不是拯救，而是一场“彻彻底底的谋杀”。

## Loki in Medicine God: The Technological Violence of Swallowing Death

“Whoever robs one of the will to swallow is a Loki among the Gods of Medicine.”

From the first suckle of milk at birth to the final spoonful in old age, human beings have always used eating to prove: _I am still alive._ To eat is to renew the primal covenant between life and the world—a most direct affirmation of existence. To deprive someone of eating is to sever that most original connection between body and being.

Medicine, once meant to assist life, now disguises itself as salvation while quietly stripping patients of the ability to eat. At the edge of decline, it hastens the collapse of the system. What it severs is not only bodily function—but the root of will itself. In its extreme, it becomes a form of technical violence—_a medical killing._

No blades, no bullets—just a pill, cold and voiceless. It does not bleed, yet slowly steals one’s ability to eat, drains vitality, fails organs—until death arrives.

What is truly terrifying is not death itself, But the dignity of life already hollowed out. This is not rescue—It is murder, through and through.
