夜深，废弃的广场上，一团漂浮的“科学”悄然现身，像一段未解的公式，摇曳在月光下。一群流浪狗缓缓围拢过来，眼中闪着迷惘的光芒。科学时而飘忽，时而停驻，像在挑衅，又似在引诱。狗们缓慢地追逐，瘦骨嶙峋的身影在光圈里拉得长长，仿佛紧抓着某种命运的尾巴。

人们从广场外走过，嘲笑着这荒诞的场景，转身离去。狗继续追，科学继续飘。天亮时，狗群四散而去，留下空荡的广场，和空气中一丝虚无的气味。

Late at night, in the abandoned square, a floating "science" quietly emerges, like an unsolved equation, swaying under the moonlight. A group of stray dogs slowly gathers around, their eyes gleaming with a confused light. Science drifts intermittently, sometimes fleeting, sometimes pausing, as if provoking or perhaps enticing. The dogs chase slowly, their emaciated figures elongated in the halo of light, as if desperately clutching the tail of some fate.

People walk by the square, mocking the absurd scene, and turn away. The dogs continue their pursuit, science continues to float. By dawn, the pack disperses, leaving behind an empty square and a faint smell of emptiness lingering in the air.
