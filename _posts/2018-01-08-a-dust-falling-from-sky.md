混沌王国，明亮白云悬挂低空；凶险迷蒙大洋，正拍打海岸边的“铁船”。

最初，尘埃没有名字，  
它更像是颗生命种子；  
接受了命运安排，跟随风的方向，  
一路飘在哪……  
风停，歇息下疲惫身躯；  
风起，继续夹杂于其他尘埃之中。

（尘埃不知，自己来自何方，又将要去到哪里；想要摆脱上苍对于自己的控制，却又不得不依附他们找寻到一个安稳的落脚点。）

不由自主，深似浮萍。

在穿越沙漠的中途；  
累了、停靠，期待下次的风。  
飞跃天空的日子，有幸去看天边云彩；  
沉睡于她的怀抱。  
偶尔，遭遇持续狂风，  
不由怀疑自己真实使命。

（逗留沙漠，四处荒芜，尘埃唯恐属于它们中的一员；而云的怀抱，感受又是那么温暖，热烈。）

路漫漫，其修远。

尘埃坚信，  
某天一定能够成为一颗真正种子。  
怀揣生命，降临——  
在经受一切必要经受的洗礼、考验之后：  
成功落进“地狱”，  
坠入生的海洋。

The chaotic kingdom, bright white clouds hang low; the dangerous and misty ocean, hitting the “iron ship” on the coast.

In the beginning, dust had no name,  
It was more like a seed of life;  
Accepting the arrangement of fate, following the direction of the wind,  
Drifting all the way…  
When the wind stopped, it rested its tired body;  
When the wind rose, it continued to mix with other dust.

(The dust did not know where it came from or where it was going; it wanted to break free from the control of the heavens, but had to rely on them to find a stable foothold.)

Involuntarily, deep like duckweed.

In the middle of crossing the desert;  
Tired, docked, looking forward to the next wind.  
Flying across the sky, fortunate to see the clouds at the horizon;  
Sleeping in her embrace.  
Occasionally, encountering a persistent gale,  
Wondering about its true mission.

(Staying in the desert, desolate everywhere, dust fearing to be one of them; while the embrace of clouds, feeling so warm and passionate.)

The road is long and far.

Dust firmly believed,  
That one day it would become a real seed.  
Carrying life, descending –  
After undergoing all the necessary baptism and test:  
Successfully falling into “hell”,  
Plunging into the sea of life.
