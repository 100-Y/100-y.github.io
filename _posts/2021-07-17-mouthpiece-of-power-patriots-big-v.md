指望“爱国大V”们（假爱国）关注，对外影响不好的大事，那是在茅坑里打电筒——（找屎）。Ta们爱的不是国，更不是她的国民；而是向上的权力，是打着爱国主义旗帜，挂人民路灯而非“资本家”（广义）的蛀虫、真流氓。

Expect the “Patriots Big V” (Fake Patriots) to pay attention to a major event with bad external influence, that is to turn on a flashlight in the toilet — (looking for shit). What they love is not the country, let alone her citizens; but the upward power, hanging the people on the street lamps, under the banner of patriotism, rather than the “capitalists”, they are worms and real hooligans.
