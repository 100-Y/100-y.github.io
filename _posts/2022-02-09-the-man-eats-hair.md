梦里，**地毯下有一股十分怪异的东西在来回奔跑**。我追它，拿屋内的东西，也用脚。

可无论如何都阻止不了。它挣脱地毯，沿着墙壁、逃到隔壁有人地方的时候。使得我恐惧心理，瞬间充满全脑和全身，使得**整个房子都弥漫恐怖的气氛**。时间不知道过去了多久……

来到隔壁房间，只见烟熏火燎，有些人点火，有些人翻窗帘。有些人在烟里，看都看不见。还有一个人，站在那里一动不动。我也不由自主到处找来一堆打火机，能打着不能打着的，找来都攥在手里。不知道这里又发生了些什么事情。

那人是个女的。肚子很大，像怀了孕似的。嘴角有一些血丝，像是**被某种东西伤着了**。屋内其ta人好像很怕她，都不敢靠近。仿佛认为她一定会伤害ta们。有时她的神情动态很夸张，尝试做出扑人的动作。我知道，她的内心和头脑还算清醒，至少照她目前的样子来看。

经过耐心“劝导”她和大家，并四处找来“交通工具”以后，决定由我**自作主张，将她送往医院**……

真热心肠啊！到了，医院有个，人行阶梯，五十来级，需要她自己爬上去。她说她爬不了，很累，坚持不下去，于是我先爬上、去找医生。

就在爬上、看到医生的时间，**阶梯上很多陌生人在开枪**，不知道具体是哪些，一些开头房间里的大家，又像是身边熟悉的亲人。枪枪打往下面的某个人。我回过头，只看见我带来医院、寻求医生帮忙的她，正追着她周围的人，身体里窜出，丝丝那个怪异的东西……

**场景定格**，我不知道怎么办。我不知道是“熟悉家人”先开枪，还是\*\*“体内有怪异东西的她”\*\*先吸血、咬人。

但我肯定，这事一开始就与我相关。一开始我就知道这怪异的东西是什么，在它逃脱地毯、漏出半个“身体”，“头”向后弯曲的那个瞬间，我就知道了它是什么。在地毯下，无论怎样都阻它不止逃脱，就该明确告诉隔壁屋里的人它是什么。大家烟熏火燎一起想要“处理”它的时候，**我就不该瞒着大家，违背大家的意愿**。

因为我“内心恐惧、怀有私心”。但是，就像自己讲的那样：我不知道是“家人”先招惹它，还是“怪异东西”后被迫伤人。**我不知道**。我只知道：定格停了，我的内心肯定不会再恐惧、肯定不会再怀有私心。

**我的归宿，一开始就该是我的归宿。**

Dream, **there was a very strange thing running back and forth under the carpet**. I chased it, using things in the room, and my feet.

But no matter what, I couldn’t stop it. It broke free from the carpet, along the wall, and escaped to the next room where there were people. It made my fear psychology, instantly fill my whole brain and body, making **the whole house filled with a terrifying atmosphere**. Don’t know how long time passed…

I came to the next room, only to see smoke and fire, some people lit fires, some people turned over curtains. Some people were in the smoke, invisible. And there was one person standing there motionless. I also involuntarily found a bunch of lighters, some that could light and some that couldn’t, and held them in my hand. Don’t know what happened here.

That person was a woman. Her belly was very big, like she was pregnant. There was some blood on the corner of her mouth, like she was **hurt by something**. The other people in the room seemed to be afraid of her, and didn’t dare to approach. As if they thought she would definitely hurt them. Sometimes her expression was very exaggerated, trying to make a pouncing motion. I knew that her heart and mind were still clear, at least according to her current appearance.

After patiently “persuading” her and everyone, and finding “transportation” everywhere, I decided to **take the initiative and send her to the hospital**…

So kind-hearted! When we got there, the hospital had a human ladder, about fifty steps, that she had to climb up by herself. She said she couldn’t climb it, she was tired, she couldn’t hold on, so I climbed up first and went to find a doctor.

Just as I climbed up and saw the doctor, **many strangers on the ladder were shooting guns**. I don’t know who they were exactly. Some of them were from the first room, and some were like familiar relatives around me. They shot at someone below. I looked back and saw the woman I brought to the hospital for help from the doctor, chasing the people around her, with strands of that strange thing coming out of her body…

**The scene froze**, and I didn’t know what to do. I don’t know if it was the “familiar family” who provoked it first, or “**she strange thing inside**” suck and bite first.

But I’m sure this thing had something to do with me from the beginning. From the beginning I knew what this strange thing was. When it escaped from the carpet and showed half of its “body”, its “head” bent backwards in that instant, I knew what it was. Under the carpet, no matter how I tried to stop it from escaping, I should have told the people in the next room what it was. When everyone wanted to “deal” with it together in smoke and fire, **I shouldn’t have hidden it from everyone and gone against everyone’s wishes**.

Because I was “fearful in my heart and selfish”. But as I said: I don’t know if it was the “family” who provoked it first or the “strange thing” who was forced to hurt people later. **I don’t know**. All I know is: when the scene froze stopped, my heart would definitely not be afraid anymore, definitely not be selfish anymore.

**My destination, should have been my destination from the beginning.**
