他们说自己是红的，是旗帜的一角，是忠诚的化身，可他们挥动的不是温柔的风，而是利刃。他们的声音高过真相，他们的立场硬过苦难。每一次怒斥都不是献给压迫者，而是击打在求生者的胸口。

他们爱国，却不爱人；他们护国，却厌民；他们喊出江山万岁，却忘了江山是人。于是，红成了一层皮，包裹着冷漠的骨与仇的心。

他们是新时代的支黑，不在远方，而在身边；不说反话，却做反事；不揭短，却堵口。他们是信仰的伪影，是铁血的幻觉，是披着忠诚燃烧人民的无声火种。

## The New Era's Anti-Chinese: Oppressors Cloaked in Loyalty

They call themselves red—an edge of the flag, a symbol of loyalty. But what they wave is no breeze of compassion—it is a blade. Their voices drown out the truth; their stance is harder than suffering itself. Every outburst of rage falls not on oppressors, but hammers the chest of those struggling to survive.

They love the nation, but not its people. They defend the state, but loathe its citizens. They chant, “Long live the motherland!” yet forget that the motherland is made of lives. So red becomes only a skin—wrapped around bones of indifference and a heart seething with hatred.

They are the "anti-Chinese" of the new era—not in some distant land, but beside us. They speak no sarcasm, yet act in contradiction. They expose no flaws, but silence every dissent.They are the counterfeit of conviction, the hallucination of iron-blooded honor, the silent flame cloaked in loyalty—burning the people it claims to serve.
