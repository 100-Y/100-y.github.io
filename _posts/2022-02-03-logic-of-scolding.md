人是很贱的一种生物。

举例：只有当ta们想好了ta们为什么要结婚、为什么要孕育后代，结婚、孕育后代，之后，ta们才不会后悔，才不会经受不住诱惑、选择出轨，才不会……

可往往ta们不怎么花时间去想，等着。等着，时间慢慢告诉ta们，等着残酷的真相摆在ta们面前，等着ta们看ta们自己后悔。后悔结婚得早、后悔生了孩子、又后悔选择离了婚、后悔来到这个世界之上……ta们中的很多，后悔孑然一身的ta们。

ta们中也有的人，不贱。ta们从不透露一丝ta们自己的贱，所以外人，压根也不知道ta们曾经贱过。

贱是一种性格，人类反省自我行为的一种品格。性格有好、有不好、也有坏，有的人有这类品格、有的人无；贱不一样，针对的是每一个体、ta自己，性格+品格=品性。不是有无的问题，是严重程度与否。

于是有的人，说贱，ta不一定是在骂人，ta有可能是在骂ta自己。说人很贱，那就不一定了！所以：当有人骂你贱以后，你不能“你才贱”骂回去。而是选择说，“没你贱”+“我贱，你比我还贱！”+“你是真贱！”。

你甚至应该都不把那称做骂。

Humans are a very cheap kind of creature.

For example: Only when they have figured out why they want to get married, why they want to have children, and then get married and have children, they will not regret it, they will not be tempted to cheat, they will not…

But often they don’t spend much time thinking about it, just waiting. Waiting for time to slowly tell them, waiting for the cruel truth to be in front of them, waiting for them to see themselves regret. Regret getting married early, regret having children, and then regret getting divorced, regret coming to this world… Many of them, regret being alone.

Some of them are not cheap. They never reveal a trace of their own cheapness, so outsiders don’t even know that they have ever been cheap.

Cheapness is a kind of personality, a kind of character that human beings reflect on their own behavior. Personality has good, not good, and also bad, some people have this kind of character, some people do not; cheapness is different, it is aimed at every individual, themselves, personality + character = temperament. It’s not a matter of having or not, but of how serious or not.

So some people say cheapness, they may not be scolding others, they may be scolding themselves. Saying that someone is very cheap, that’s not necessarily the case! So: when someone scolds you for being cheap, you can’t scold back with “you are the one who is cheap”. Instead, you should choose to say, “not as cheap as you” + “I’m cheap, but you’re even cheaper than me!” + “You are really cheap!”.

You shouldn’t even call that scolding.
