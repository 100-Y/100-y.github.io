请不要把一个人想的很好，也不要把一个人看得很坏！打的坐出租车，一定开窗留个缝隙。洗澡，也一定留个风口。学会预见！尤其关乎身家性命的事情，务必联想其有可能导致的最坏过程和后果。

一定程度的杞人忧天是非常有必要的！

真理也难有绝对，从理性的角度出发，学会质疑和用辩证批判的眼光去对待事情。莫让情绪奴役了思想和肉体……世上难得两全法。讲究中庸的道理，现今看来，也还蛮适用于这个社会！

不是讲就不要去做好事，而是让大家为自己留个见证。防人之心不可无，害人之心，也一定不要有的！

Please do not think of a person very well, and do not think of a person very bad! If you take a taxi, be sure to open the window and leave a gap. When you take a bath, you must leave a tuyere. Learn to foresee! Especially when it comes to life and fortune, be sure to associate it with the worst possible process and consequences.

A certain degree of alarmist worry is very necessary!

Truth is also difficult to be absolute, from a rational point of view, learn to question and treat things with dialectical and critical eyes. Don’t let emotions enslave the mind and the body.… It is rare to have two laws in the world. Pay attention to the doctrine of the mean, now it seems that it is quite applicable to this society!

It’s not that if you say so, don’t do good deeds, but let everyone keep a witness for themselves. The heart to guard against others must not be absent, and the heart to harm others must not be allowed to exist.
