步骤1。定义自己给出的“专有名词”。  
步骤2。类比“专有名词”。  
步骤3。“专有名词”定义和类比的结合，然后重新隐喻。  
步骤4。生成草稿，整理草稿。  
步骤5。使用更为精炼的语言。总结、概括。

比如：**指南针和莽夫，嘴炮大王与无头苍蝇**。

指南针定义：**善于设定远景目标和方向**。他们通常具有宏大的视野和理想，能够提出令人振奋的愿景，但却常常缺乏将目标落实为可行步骤的具体方法。他们的规划往往很宏观，却在细节和实际执行上有所欠缺。特点：方向性强、擅长激励，缺乏执行力和落地方案。

莽夫定义：**强调行动力和执行速度**。他们通常更重视“做”而非“想”，往往不注重全面分析和规划细节，容易陷入盲目推进的状态。他们的行为风格是强硬和直接的，甚至在面对风险时也会选择强行推动项目。特点：行动力强、果断直接，缺乏战略思考和全局视角，容易因缺乏计划而造成失误。

嘴炮大王定义：**喜欢发表激烈言辞或行事夸张**。他们擅长在会议或讨论中提出各种主张和建议，表面上非常有想法和热情，但实际行动往往跟不上口头承诺。他们的主要表现是“说得多、做得少”。特点：表达欲强、言辞夸张，缺乏实际行动，容易造成团队内部的沟通噪音。

无头苍蝇定义：**缺乏清晰方向和独立思考**。他们通常只是盲目服从指令，没有明确的目标意识和判断力，容易被不同的命令牵着走，在任务中迷失方向，效率低下。特点：行动无序、缺乏独立思考，容易因没有目标感而浪费时间和资源。

比如：指南针（类比一个国家的**最高领袖**），莽夫（类比**暴力机关**），嘴炮大王（类比**各级行政官员**），无头苍蝇（类比**基层干事员工**）。

比如“善于设定远景目标和方向的最高领袖”隐喻为“**高飞的鸟**”，“强调行动力和执行速度的暴力机关”隐喻为“**莽撞的猛兽**”，“喜欢发表激烈言辞或行事夸张的各级行政官员”隐喻为“**喧闹的鹦鹉**”，“缺乏清晰方向和独立思考的基层干事员工”隐喻为“**无头苍蝇般的小虫子**”。

- Step 1: Define the "proper nouns" you provide.
- Step 2: Draw analogies for the "proper nouns."
- Step 3: Combine the definitions and analogies of the "proper nouns", to create new metaphors.
- Step 4: Generate a draft and organize it.  
    Step 5: Use more concise language. Summarize and condense.

For example: **Compass and Brute, Blowhard and Headless Fly**.

Compass Definition: **Skilled at setting long-term goals and direction**. They typically possess grand visions and ideals, able to propose inspiring visions but often lack concrete methods to translate these goals into actionable steps. Their planning is often macro-focused, but they fall short in details and execution. Characteristics: Strong directional sense, good at motivation, but lacking in execution and practical plans.

Brute Definition: **Emphasizes action and execution speed**. They usually prioritize "doing" over "thinking," often neglecting comprehensive analysis and planning details, leading to a state of blind advancement. Their style is tough and direct, even pushing projects forcefully in the face of risks. Characteristics: Strong in action, decisive and direct, but lacking strategic thinking and a holistic perspective, prone to errors due to lack of planning.

Blowhard Definition: **Enjoys making extravagant statements or exaggerated actions**. They excel at proposing various claims and suggestions in meetings or discussions, appearing very passionate and full of ideas, but their actual actions often do not match their verbal promises. Their main trait is "talking a lot, doing little." Characteristics: Strong desire for expression, exaggerated speech, lacking actual action, can create communication noise within the team.

Headless Fly Definition: **Lacks clear direction and independent thinking**. They usually follow orders blindly, with no clear sense of goals or judgment, easily swayed by different commands, losing direction in tasks, and being inefficient. Characteristics: Disordered action, lacking independent thought, prone to wasting time and resources due to lack of a sense of purpose.

For example: Compass (analogous to **the supreme leader** of a country), Brute (analogous to **a violent organization**), Blowhard (analogous to **administrative officials at all levels**), Headless Fly (analogous to **grassroots staff members**).

For instance, "the supreme leader skilled at setting long-term goals and direction" is metaphorically represented as "**a flying bird**," "a violent organization emphasizes action and execution speed" as "**a reckless beast**," "administrative officials at all levels enjoy making extravagant statements or exaggerated actions" as "**a noisy parrot**," and "grassroots staff members lack clear direction and independent thinking" as "**a headless fly-like little bug**."
