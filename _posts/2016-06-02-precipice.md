绝壁，  
事物的边界概念。  
它的尽头，似衣褶，  
是织边、裙摆，一次周围的装饰。  
是白天交班夜晚间歇的风。  
分割的栅栏，或是圆形状边沿似刘海，某个次要的余下。  
是:  
国家明令禁止、慎用的失检行为，下意识在通道发生。  
那些无人开拓的贫瘠土地……  
以及使人陷入疏忽濒临眨眼的界值，  
无时不刻，没被发现的一切。

- Cliff,
- Concept of the boundary of things.
- At the end of it, looks like a pleat,
- It is the weaving edge, the hem, one surrounding decoration.
- It is the wind that intermittently shifts during the day and at night.
- Divided fences, or circular borders like bangs, a certain minor remainder.
- It is:
- Acts of misconduct that are explicitly prohibited and used cautiously by the state, occur subconsciously in the aisle.
- Those barren lands that no one explored…
- And the threshold that leads to negligence on the verge of blinking,
- All the time, the everything goes undiscovered.
