生老病死，过程难免。有的“讶异”，有的“无感”；有的发文删帖，有的辟谣打脸。人老了，自然就会离死亡更近一步啊！讳疾忌医的道理大家都懂；可讳莫如深谈论一些事情，真的没有必要。死亡的一层本意，指的是灵魂解脱身体，或许灵魂能找到更好的“归宿”，虽然只是或许，但死亡，这样也不见得总是会成为一件不好的事情。

Birth, aging, sickness and death are inevitable processes. Some are “surprised”, some are “indifferent”; some post and delete, some refute and slap. When people get old, they naturally get closer to death! Everyone understands the reason of hiding one’s illness; but it is really unnecessary to talk about some things in a secretive way. One of the meanings of death is that the soul is freed from the body, perhaps the soul can find a better “destination”, although it is only perhaps, but death, may not always be a bad thing.
