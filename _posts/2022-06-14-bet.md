我和我妈在赌：我敢不敢跳楼……我站在窗边顺势做出翻身的姿势。她那一点不深以为然的脸孔，嘴里同时喊着“跳啊、跳啊”。我就知道，她赌不起。

她从没觉得她自己有问题，也没真正有一刻了解过我；对此，我是一点儿希望没抱，庆幸她无论如何，都插手不了我正在做的事情：比如打赌。

于病态的人来说，ta们没什么不敢；如果跳楼是件让人高兴的事情，ta们会毅然决然，去做。

My mom and I are betting: whether I dare to jump off the building… I stand by the window and make a gesture of turning over. Her face that doesn’t take it seriously, and her mouth shouting “jump, jump” at the same time. I know, she can’t afford to lose.

She never thought she had a problem, and she never really understood me for a moment; I had no hope for that, and I was glad that she couldn’t interfere with what I was doing anyway: like betting.

For sick people, there is nothing they dare not to do; if jumping off the building is something that makes them happy, they will do it resolutely.
