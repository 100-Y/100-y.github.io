在我看来，至少男同是。年龄差距很大的更是。这是一种对于人格意义上的操控。国家应该建立、健全有关变性人的法案，鼓励这类人士，自愿接受心理治疗，甚至为他们提供免费的性别改造服务。

与其说同性恋有没有病，不如讨论同性之间发生关系，世俗容忍的限度。往往女性之间，要比男性，世俗容易接受的多。又男同、痔疮患者，发生关系，感染艾滋病的概率，是否要比没有痔疮的，大很多？相反，女性不太会有这个问题……

In my opinion, at least gay men are. The big age gap is even more. This is a kind of manipulation in the sense of personality. The country(state) should establish and improve laws on transgender people, encourage such people to receive psychotherapy voluntarily, and even provide them with free gender transformation services.

Rather than say whether homosexuality is sick or not, it is better to discuss the limits of secular tolerance of homosexual relationships. Women are more likely to be accepted by the world than men. And gay men have hemorrhoids, have sex, the probability of being infected with AIDS, is it much more than those without hemorrhoids? On the contrary, women are less likely to have this problem.
