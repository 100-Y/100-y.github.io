坚持做好一件事情并不容易，因为有很多很多的诱惑，要你去戒除，或是时间长短，但始终有困难、难以戒除……而这些诱惑，真实造就你以后的遗憾。

世界上本就没有太多什么唾手可得的东西，好比知识一样得学会分辨吸收，不能人们告诉你什么，你就相信什么就是什么。越是寒蝉噤若没有辨知的年代，越要学会自我放逐。

It is not easy to persist in doing one thing well, because there are many, many temptations that you have to quit, or the length of time, but there are always difficulties and difficult to quit… And these temptations really create your future regrets.

There are not many things in the world that can be obtained by hand, just like knowledge, you have to learn to distinguish and absorb, you can’t believe what people tell you what is what. The more it is the age of cicadas without discernment, the more you have to learn to exile yourself.
