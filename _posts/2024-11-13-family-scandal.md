家丑，总在遮蔽中沉默。每一次真相撕裂帷幕，迎来的却是愤怒与打压。掩盖源于对“体面”的执念，仿佛真相的曝光便是集体尊严的崩塌。

但压制只会换来短暂的平静，深埋的问题终究酿成更大的隐患。家丑如埋藏的火种，与其掩盖，不如直面裂痕，让破碎成为和解与重生的契机。

Family scandals often linger in silence, hidden beneath layers of secrecy. Each revelation that tears away the veil is met with anger and suppression. This concealment stems from a fixation on preserving "dignity," as if exposing the truth would spell the collapse of collective honor.

Yet, suppression only brings fleeting calm, while buried issues inevitably grow into deeper crises. Scandals are like dormant embers—rather than conceal them, it is better to confront the cracks and turn the rupture into an opportunity for reconciliation and renewal.
