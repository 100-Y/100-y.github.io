我不再等那个回信息的人。他甚至不知道我撑伞的那晚，鞋子进了水，脚在地铁里冻得发青……我开始收藏被拒绝时的表情——嘴角翘了一点又放下的那种，那是他们内心的真实……如果我是一只装满热水的瓶子，我要把瓶口拧紧，不再漏出去。

I’m no longer waiting for the one who never texts back. He doesn’t even know that on the night I held the umbrella, water soaked my shoes, and my feet turned blue with cold in the subway… I’ve started collecting the expressions people make when they reject you—that slight lift of the mouth, quickly falling back, that’s where their true feelings hide. If I were a bottle filled with hot water, I would twist the cap tight, and never let it spill again.
