权力掌握在年轻人手里，是个灾难；因为年轻人爱国，盲目。权力掌握在老年人手里，是另一个灾难；因为老年人爱国，自以为是。那么谁，应该掌握权力，那些实事求是的官员，将会是最好的选择。

与其在不确定性和历史的转折点来回摇摆，不如采取最最稳妥的方式，平稳地度过。

Power in the hands of young people is a disaster; because young people love their country, blindly. Power in the hands of old people is another disaster; because old people love their country, self-righteous. So who should hold power, those officials seeking truth from facts, will be the best choice.

Instead of wavering between uncertainty and historical turning points, it is better to adopt the most prudent way and get through smoothly.
