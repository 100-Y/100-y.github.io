初心，本是照亮理想的火种，却在权力面前悄然变质。有人以“为人民”的名义行私利之实，以“革命需要”为盾，将特权披上正义的外衣。他们高举平等，实则筑起新的等级；呼喊解放，却渴望独占话语。斗争是他们的舞台，群众是背景，理想成了装饰性的布景。初心不过是一件精致的戏服，用来打动人心，也用来掩盖贪欲。最终，当硝烟散尽，他们最先退场，只留下新一轮特权秩序和一块冷冷的碑：**为理想，谋特权。**

The original aspiration was meant to be the spark that illuminated our ideals, yet it quietly deteriorated in the face of power. Some act in the name of "serving the people" while pursuing personal gain; they wield "revolutionary necessity" as a shield, cloaking privilege in the garb of justice. They raise the banner of equality, yet construct new hierarchies; they shout for liberation, yet yearn to monopolize discourse. Struggle is their stage, the masses merely the backdrop, and ideals—nothing more than ornamental scenery. The original aspiration becomes a finely crafted costume, used to stir hearts and to mask greed. In the end, as the smoke of battle clears, they are the first to exit the stage, leaving behind a new cycle of privilege and a cold, lifeless monument: “For ideals, for privilege.”
