修行的人，相信死后有灵魂：“她/他们的灵魂，终将引领着她/他们去到她/他们想去的地方”。说生死，说“生”它就是死，说“死”它就是生……怎样看待的一个问题。这点，我、和我们……也都应和她/他们一样，十分确信。

People who believe in Buddhism, believe that there is a soul after death: “Their soul, will eventually lead them to where they want to go”. Talking about life and death, say “life” and it is death, you say “death” and it is life… A problem that how to look at. This point, I, and we… should also be very confident like them.
