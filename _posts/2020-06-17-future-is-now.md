人类出生的目的，是获得灵魂的解脱。死亡，只是灵魂得到解脱的一条真理。真理，虽其它还有很多条，包括做人类自己！包括开导和解脱自己、乃至其它同胞的灵魂！包括诚实、无惧面对所有！但最大的真理，还是莫过于第一条！

佛教真正厉害的是，它虽看透了人类本质，它却不鼓吹死亡，它激励人如何坦然地面对一切。它给你讲轮回！这样看来，佛教本质上也算洗脑。无非和其它洗脑的手法一样，但洗的却是一手好脑子！

人类终将灭亡，这是不变真理！而人类集体灭亡的那天，才是全部灵魂获得自由的时刻。所以，还是活在当下吧，未即当下！活着就是在死亡。

The purpose of human birth is to obtain the liberation of the soul. Death is only a truth in the liberation of the soul. Although there are many other truths, including being human beings! Including enlightening and liberating the souls of oneself and other compatriots! Including honesty, not afraid to face everything! But the greatest truth is the first!

What is really powerful about Buddhism is that although it sees through the nature of human beings, it does not advocate death, and it inspires people to face everything calmly. It tells you about reincarnation! In this way, Buddhism is essentially brainwashing. It is nothing but the same as other methods of brainwashing, but it washes a good brain!

Mankind will perish, This is the immutable truth! And the day of the collective demise of mankind, Is the moment when all souls are free. So live in the moment, Future is now! To live is to die.
