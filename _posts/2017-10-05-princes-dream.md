幻想身处一片荒野，那里没有邪恶幽灵；荒野尽头，善人等待梦中人清醒……

那是一个凉风清秋的早晨，  
王子随军穿越迷蒙森林；  
森林静谧无声，  
唯风席卷枯树叶，树叶瑟瑟发抖。  
周遭空气，连同湿润的灌木丛群，  
夹杂、弥漫开来；  
负重马匹，也开始显现、  
印照出这个季节，路上独有的车辙……

“仁慈施于国家，较之武力征服、统治诸部，是为莫大欢喜。”说完，王子转身，意欲独自一人，歇息。

（至夜，马修入梦……）

“睡梦中的少年，莫要惊怕，某人会道明来意。  
不过，首先。请知悉二十年前王国战役的惨败真相：  
邪恶首领薨、怛，勾结、策反王国封臣；  
战时王军陷入困境，你父亲孤立无援，  
最后因此毙命的事实。

然后，以及。  
怛，邪恶首领，薨的长子；  
王薨——海城墙战役直接策划参与者……”

（黎明，星辰渐露微光；马修即将离去。）

“务必记住这简短对话，莫让无知丧了性命。最后，现实里。我们会再次相遇，以各自人模的形态……”

（说完，天亮、王子梦醒，马修魂飞魄散。）

Dreaming in a wilderness, where there is no evil ghost; At the end of the place, good man waiting for the dreamer to wake up…

It was a cool autumn morning,  
Prince crossed the misty forest with his army;  
Forest was silent,  
Only the wind swept dry leaves, and the leaves shivered.  
Surrounding air, along with moist shrubs,  
Mixed and spread;  
The burdened horses, also began to show  
And reflect this season, unique ruts on the road…

“Mercy to the nation, rather than conquering and ruling the tribes by force, is the greatest joy.” After saying that, the prince turned around, intending to rest by himself.

(At night, Matthew entered his dream…)

“Don’t be afraid, young man in your sleep, someone will explain their purpose.  
But first. Please know the truth of the disastrous defeat of the kingdom’s war twenty years ago:  
The evil leader Hong and Da, colluded and turned against the kingdom’s vassals;  
The king’s army was in trouble during the war, your father was isolated and helpless,  
And finally died because of this.

And then.  
Da, the eldest son of the evil leader Hong;  
And the King Hong — was directly involved in planning the Battle of Seawall…”

(Dawn, the stars gradually showed a faint light; Matthew was about to leave.)

“Be sure to remember this brief conversation, don’t let ignorance lose your life. Finally, in reality. We will meet again, in our own human forms…”

(After saying that, it was daylight, the prince woke up from his dream, and Matthew’s soul flew away.)
