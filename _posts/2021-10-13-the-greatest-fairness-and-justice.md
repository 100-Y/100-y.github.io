法律人定，由人参与和判决；而人有缺陷。所以其规定的公平、正义，只是相对客观、正确。如果连，相对（和稀泥），都保证和维持不了；那么，此刻，对“法律”进行践踏便就成了最大的公平与正义！

The law is made and participated in and judged by man; and man is flawed. That is why the fairness and justice it prescribes are only relatively objective and correct. If even the relative (and muddled) cannot be guaranteed and maintained; then, at this moment, trampling on the “law” becomes the greatest fairness and justice!
