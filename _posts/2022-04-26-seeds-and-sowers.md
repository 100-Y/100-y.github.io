有些人视种子为毒药，视播种者为恶人，ta们自以为是主的使者，不惜屠杀无辜；Ta们不懂，种子孕育着生命的奥秘，播种者传递着希望的火花。

- Some people see seeds as poison, and sowers as evildoers; they think they are the messengers of the Lord, and do not hesitate to slaughter the innocent; they do not understand, seeds nurture mystery of life, the sowers convey the spark of hope.
