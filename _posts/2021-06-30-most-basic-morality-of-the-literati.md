问题总是存在的！睁眼瞎的人不少，自个儿瞎就算了；再忽悠其他人说：瞎有它的好处！这类人，已全然忘记自身所处的阶层，沦为既得利益者的口舌；成为拱卫他们力量的“打手”。

其中的一些积极分子，为了个人乃至小集团的利益，包括获取“上层”更大的青睐和奖赏，行事作风变得更加强硬。如果，“上层”明辨是非，懂得人心和人民还好；坏的就是他们也被“利益”冲昏了眼，一起跟着瞎了！

不为资本和权力讲话，是文人最基本的道德。

There are always problems! There are a lot of people who are blind (to see), just let they blind themselves; but fool others and saying: blindness has its benefits! Such people have completely forgotten their own class, become the tongues of those Vested Interests; and “Goons” to defend their strength.

And some of the activists’ styles of behavior have become tougher, for the benefit of their individuals and even small groups, including to gain greater favor and reward from the “Upper Class”. If the “Upper” distinguish right from wrong, and understand the hearts of the soul and people, can be good things, the bad is that they are also blinded by “Interests”, blind themselves too!

Not speaking for capital and power, is most basic morality of the literati.
