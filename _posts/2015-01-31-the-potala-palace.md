想现在就坐火车去看你，  
想你维持这模样就一直。  
想还要有时间魔术师，  
让时间飞转到2100年。  
找到那时的“我”，  
让他也来，看“你”——  
看我，看布达拉宫。

- Want to take a train to see you now,
- Want you to remain just like this forever.
- Wish there were a time magician,
- To fast-forward time to the year 2100.
- To find the “me” from that time,
- So that he can also come, and see “you” —
- See me, seeing the Potala Palace.
