梦里初中、课上，手写了半篇8、9万字的作文。四处找订书机，怎么排队与借，也轮不到我。在同学们都差不多装订好、上交完毕的时候，我的作业本子又突然变成了一本厚的书……

手足无措的我，灵机一动，打算扫描图片、保存电子档，来传输这半篇的语文作业。可那时候、那环境，哪里有以上先进的理念和设备支持啊！

至于梦里，《半篇作文》内容都写了一些什么？往往，只有现实，才会给出一个像样的答案。

In dream, junior high school, class, I wrote half of an 80,000-90,000 word composition by hand. I looked around for a stapler, but no matter how I queued up and borrowed, it was not my turn. When most of classmates had finished binding and handing in their homework, my notebook suddenly turned into a thick book…

I was at a loss, and had a flash of inspiration, decided to scan the pictures, save the electronic files, and transfer this half of the Chinese homework. But at that time, in that environment, where were the above advanced ideas and equipment to support it!

As for what I wrote in my dream, in the half composition? Often, only reality will give a decent answer.
