date: 2025-04-11
excerpt: 文章通过喇叭与隧道的隐喻，揭示表达在媒介放大下的异化过程，反思现代语言如何被技术剥离主观性，沦为机制化的虚响。The article, through the metaphors of the megaphone and tunnel, reveals how expression is alienated under media amplification, reflecting on the loss of subjectivity in modern language as it becomes a mechanized echo.

那人没有头，只有一个朝向隧道的喇叭——不为看见，只为放大。他站在语言的尽头，将沉默导向光亮的回声腔体。隧道不是出口，而是意义的反复折返；喇叭不是主体的声音，而是空洞的放逐器。当表达被外化为器械，我们是否仍在言说，还是只是回响的中继站？在这个异化的结构中，最尖锐的呐喊，也许早已不属于人本身。

The figure has no head—only a megaphone aimed at the tunnel, not to see, but to amplify. He stands at the edge of language, channeling silence into a chamber of luminous echoes. The tunnel is no exit, but a recursive loop of meaning; the megaphone, not a voice of the self, but an empty device of exile. When expression is outsourced to machinery, are we still speaking—or merely relaying a sound that is no longer ours? In this alienated architecture, the sharpest cry may no longer belong to the one who utters it.
