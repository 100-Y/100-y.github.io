楼下一群小年轻闹麻了，像是夜宵喝酒，收费停靠的车子开不出栏杆外，呜呜喳喳……那声音：尖而穿透，急而绵长。一阵比划过后，现在，城里的公鸡和我，都被ta们叫醒。

A group of young people downstairs are making a fuss, like having a late-night snack and drinking, and the car parked in the paid parking lot can’t get out of the barrier. Whining and babbling… The sound: sharp and penetrating, urgent and lingering. After a round of gestures, now, the rooster in the city and I are both awakened by them.
