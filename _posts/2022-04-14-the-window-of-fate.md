高中毕业，填报志愿，选了西藏的大学。开学第一天，认识了当地的一个女同学。

故事的导火线：是发现就读学校，是“名牌”野鸡大学，当即选择退款、退校。响应人员有二。校方人员不准，让支付违约金，不然上报法院强制执行。说是报到省教育局也管不了，并叫了校外几个混混。仓促离开之际，对女同学说，要照顾好自己。

混混在我们刚踏出校园大门就到，就要“教育”我仨不听话的外地人。双方扭打在一起，三V三，拿木棍，锁喉；打很久，似武打片一样。讲和，提出给钱摆平，一人给他们一百；替买家卖命一次也给不了那么多，还打他们。

两个“小伙伴”，继续寻找交通工具，前往火车站，准备回家；通过与小混混的对话，获知：我仨如何也逃脱不了，当地系统的“追击”。除非获得他仨的“帮助”？

小伙伴，已先行离开。

只怀疑是混混为了谋取更多利益，偶遇一辆警车，便即刻消除了佐见。车上坐着一男一女，女的像是警察情妇；靠上前，警察赶紧支棱开了她。混混笑我，就像我笑混混；我是自投罗网、瓮中捉鳖的瓜皮。车上，听到逮捕令下达，信息讲是：全城通缉，关押至青海“某地一个名字从未有人提起过的乡村”。我耐心讲述我仨遭遇的一切，警察二话不说，嗯嗯、呀呜……

梦到这里，醒就现实了。

无法相信任何人，梦里，更不要把命运的窗口交给其ta任何人：混混，警察……即便喜欢的女同学，一开始也要怀疑是否是她出卖了自己（她或许同自己一样，是受害者）。一个机构下的“相关人员”，他们都属于是“恶的代表”典型。

坐上警车后我的命运，从那一刻起，就不在完全由自己掌握。或许可以将警察一脚踢下车，尝试自己开车离开；然后更多的警察追来，“逃跑”的事被做牢。逮捕被关押至，青海“某地一个名字从未有人提起过的乡村”……

或许，当时、未知，就是最好的命；还由得即兴创作和发挥。梦里，只要我想，我就是无敌的。

After graduating from high school, I filled in my college application and chose a university in Tibet. On the first day of school, I met a local female classmate.

The fuse of the story is: I found out that the school I was attending was a “famous” diploma mill, and I immediately chose to refund and drop out. There were two respondents. The school staff did not agree, and asked me to pay a breach of contract fee, otherwise they would report it to the court for enforcement. They said that reporting to the provincial education bureau would not help, and they called a few gangsters from outside the school. When I left in a hurry, I told the female classmate to take care of herself.

The gangsters arrived just as we stepped out of the school gate, and they wanted to “educate” us three disobedient outsiders. The two sides fought together, three against three, with wooden sticks and chokeholds; fought for a long time, like a martial arts film. We offered to settle the matter with money, one hundred for each of them; they said that they couldn’t get that much for selling their lives for the buyer, and the buyer even beat them up.

The two “buddies” continued to look for transportation, headed to the train station, and prepared to go home; through the dialogue with the gangsters, we learned: that we three could not escape anyway, the local system’s “pursuit”. Unless we get their “help”?

The buddies had already left first.

Only suspecting that the gangsters were trying to get more benefits, I ran into a police car by chance, and immediately eliminated my suspicions. There was a man and a woman in the car, and the woman looked like a police mistress; i leaned forward, and the policeman quickly pushed her away. The gangsters laughed at me, just like I laughed at them; i was self-inflicted, caught in a trap. In the car, I heard the arrest order issued, and the information was: wanted throughout the city, detained in Qinghai “a place with a name that no one has ever mentioned”. I patiently told them everything that happened to us three, and the police said nothing, hmm, yeah…

I woke up reality, here of this dream.

Do not trust anyone in the dreams, let alone give fate’s window to anyone else: gangsters, police… Even the female classmate i liked, and i had to doubt whether she betrayed me (she might be like me, a victim). The “relevant personnel” under an institution are all typical representatives of “evil”.

My fate after getting on the police car was no longer completely controlled by myself from that moment on. Maybe I could kick the policeman off the car and try to drive away by myself; then more policemen would come and arrest me for “running away”. Arrested and detained in Qinghai “a place with a name that no one has ever mentioned”…

Maybe at that time, unknown was the best fate; it still allowed me to improvise and play. In my dreams, as long as i want, i am invincible.
