梦里：一旁的我，正在观摩自己录的某个影片——

坐在庄稼地里，穿着一件冬天清晰的长外套。主要内容是，关于个人追求的一些阐述。全程用语英文，仔细听，还能记得最后一句结尾语：That time was my gloden time, hahahaha~（现实的我，一定是觉得这定论，讽刺和“当今”对比的意味十足；所以梦里，也能清晰地说出、听到和记得。）——

“这样的我”。三者都在梦里……那是疫情开始前的最后一趟旅途，也是唯独当时没在朋友圈发图的一趟。

In dream: I was watching a video I recorded myself on the side —

Sitting in the crop field, wearing a clear long coat for winter. The main content was some elaboration on personal pursuits. The whole process was in English, and if I listened carefully, I could remember the last sentence: That time was my golden time, hahahaha~ (The real me must have felt that this conclusion was full of irony and contrast with the “present”; so in dream, I could also clearly say, hear and remember it.) —

“This kind of me”. All three were in dream… That was the last trip before the pandemic started, and also the only one that I didn’t post pictures on my friends circle at that time.
