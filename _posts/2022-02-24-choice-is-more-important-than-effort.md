**以房价为例**

努力替资本家卖命，接盘每个月21000元人民币的房贷；衣锦还乡，选择做自己的主人。这样看来，苟且偷生的和尚，都是要比繁荣富贵的商人，高贵。买卖高价房，实质就是在进行剥削啊！

**Taking the housing price as an example**

Working hard for the capitalists, taking over a monthly mortgage of 21,000 yuan; returning home in glory, choosing to be your own master. In this way, it seems that the monks who live in a humble way, are more noble than the businessmen who are prosperous and wealthy. Buying and selling high-priced houses is essentially exploitation!
