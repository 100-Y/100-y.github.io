做了一个“惊天地、泣鬼神”的梦：

奥运会升旗仪式，世界各地的人们跑来参加。西域的一些恐怖分子混迹其中，路上与我发生了一点摩擦。先是下榻某某地方，然后所有人一窝蜂前往广场参加升旗仪式。等总书记台上发言，完毕后，允许大家即兴讨论和表演。期间发生刺客暗杀事件……

当时嫌闹，我是闭着眼唱完国歌的。身边人群中，冒出一个刺客，几声枪响。快要击中总书记的时候，我一个箭步上前夺走枪支；反客为主，一顿操作下来，打得刺客屁滚尿流。

眼见刺客变身为一只老鼠，穿越墙上的一个小洞，逃离会堂。那会堂是用冰雪砌成，洞口很小，洞内却很大。来到广场，巡警安保，到处都是。我拍了拍身上的雪，整理下衣服，准备回会堂找鞋子的时候，遇到老同学，他冲着我笑。

我说，这都什么事呢？！期间偶然听到报告，刺客来自军方。正讨论是否要让我加入警队任职的事情——身手比军人还敏捷，胆识更是超一流。我心想，我不过一俗人而已。梦里我也能如此谦虚。这是我万万没有想到的！

Had a “Shocking Sky and Earth, Weeping Ghosts and Gods” dream:

The Olympic flag-raising ceremony, people from all over the world came to participate. Some terrorists from the Western Regions mingled among them, and had some friction with me on the way. First, they stayed somewhere, and then everyone swarmed to the square to attend the flag-raising ceremony. When the general secretary finished his speech on the stage, he allowed everyone to discuss and perform impromptu. During this time, an assassination occurred…

I was annoyed by the noise, so I closed my eyes and sang the national anthem. Among the crowd around me, an assassin emerged, and several gunshots rang out. When he was about to hit the general secretary, I stepped forward and snatched the gun; I turned the tables and beat the assassin to a pulp.

I saw the assassin turn into a mouse, pass through a small hole in the wall, and escape from the hall. The hall was built of ice and snow, the hole was very small, but the hole was very large. When I came to the square, there were police and security everywhere. I patted the snow on my body, tidied up my clothes, and was about to go back to the hall to find my shoes, when I met an old classmate who smiled at me.

I said, what is all this?! During this time, I accidentally heard a report that the assassin came from the military. They were discussing whether to let me join the police force – my skills were more agile than soldiers, and my courage was first-class. I thought to myself, I’m just a commoner. I could be so humble in my dream. This is something I never expected!
