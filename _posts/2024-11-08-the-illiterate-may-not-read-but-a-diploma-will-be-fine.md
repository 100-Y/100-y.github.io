发文凭，不过是蒙上一层光鲜的外衣，把无知装扮成一张无害的证书。可字里行间的空白，像是静默的荒野。证书在手，真相却无处可藏——那是一场自欺的盛宴，是无知在礼堂中央的舞步，背后是知识的缺席，是思想的荒芜。

真正的教育，不在那一纸文凭，而在于眼中的光芒、心中的热忱，甚至是那一刻理解世界的顿悟。文凭是门口的木牌，而识字，是踏入真知之门的钥匙。

A diploma is nothing more than a shiny exterior, a way to dress ignorance up as a harmless certificate. But the blank spaces between the lines are like silent wastelands. With the certificate in hand, the truth has nowhere to hide—it is a feast of self-deception, ignorance dancing at the center of the hall, while behind it lies the absence of knowledge and the desolation of thought.

True education is not in that piece of paper, but in the light in one's eyes, the passion in one's heart, and even in that moment of sudden understanding of the world. A diploma is merely a wooden sign at the door, while literacy is the key to entering the gate of true knowledge.
