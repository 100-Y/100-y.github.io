在25岁前都还单着的人，大都还倾向于天真地忠诚于选择喜欢的人，作为自己以后的理想伴侣。是因为还年轻，认为有金力去追求；还是因为还有信仰，所以宁缺毋滥？而之后开始慢慢妥协，转而退求其次。又是因为想要的得不到，或是仍旧不知自己想要的是什么？

岁月无情， 都怪时间太仓促。还没考虑好或是寻走下一步时，它就给你一记冲拳，把你所认为的信仰全给击碎。你慌不择路，你随波逐流。你迈不过这倒坎，因为多数人也将一样；而少数人仍旧单着，你不愿那样。不是担心后面没有更好的，害怕一直就这样单着；那就是早知道，自己想要的在这世界，根本就不存在？

注定剩下，如果是这样，请不要单着，请灵魂上学会交流。

People who are still single before 25 tend to be naive and loyal to the people they like, as their ideal partners for the future. Is it because they are young and think they have the power to pursue; or because they still have faith, so they would rather be lacking than excessive? And then they start to compromise and settle for less. Is it because they can’t get what they want, or because they still don’t know what they want?

Time is ruthless, it’s all time’s fault for being too hasty. Before you have thought well or taken the next step, it gives you a punch and shatters all your beliefs. You panic and take any path, you go with the flow. You can’t get over this setback, because most people will be the same; and a few people are still single, you don’t want to be like that. Not worried that there won’t be better ones later, afraid of being single all the time; that is, you already know that what you want in this world doesn’t exist at all?

Destined to be left alone, if that’s the case, please don’t be single, please learn to communicate with your soul.
