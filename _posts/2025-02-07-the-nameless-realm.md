在裂纹之镜的边缘，观看如同水中之火，真实与虚构的交界变成回音的迷宫。注视者的眼中倒映着创作者的影子，而创作者的沉默，成为无法翻译的低语。在象征织网的张力中，每一个标签都是一把锁，而自由只诞生于拒绝命名的时刻。

At the edge of a fractured mirror, to gaze is like watching fire beneath water — the boundary between reality and fiction becomes a labyrinth of echoes. In the eye of the observer, the shadow of the creator is reflected, while the creator’s silence becomes an untranslatable whisper. Within the tension of symbolic weaving, each label becomes a lock — and only in the refusal to name does freedom emerge.
