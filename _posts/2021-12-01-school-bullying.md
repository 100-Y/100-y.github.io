说到校园霸凌，小学在厕所里被人掐过喉咙，初中走廊楼梯的过道，被男生推过；午睡休息的时间，被女生画过眼睫毛……成绩不错，长的好看，这些都不是原因；重要的是，我将推我的同学反推了回去，也向班主任举报了其他欺负我的同学。

老师是负责任的老师，不能说好。有次全校课间操的时候，扇我耳光、让我面墙思过的是他。也不能讲坏。毕竟让我当班里纪律委员，教导我学习的也是ta。自那以后，初中再也没人敢欺负我。

高中、大学，前后十二年四海为家的日子（……广东、西藏、甘肃、成都、云南……）

庆幸有人喜欢、有人爱；庆幸自己找到了人生的追求、生活的动力；庆幸自己很早就知道：未来便是现在每一个明智的决定；也庆幸自己无比“偏执”、“执拗”，甚至“无情”！

这是世界末日都能存活下去的“宝贵”品质。

Speaking of School bullying, I was choked in the toilet by someone in elementary school, pushed by boys in the corridor stairs in junior high school; during nap time, I was drawn eyelashes by girls… Good grades, pretty looks, these are not the reasons; the important thing is, I pushed back the classmate who pushed me, and also reported to the head teacher the other classmates who bullied me.

The teacher was a responsible teacher, not say good. Once during the school break exercise, he slapped me in the face and made me face the wall. Not say bad either. After all, he made me the discipline committee member of the class and taught me to study. Since then, no one in junior high dared to bully me.

High school, college, twelve years of living in different places (Guangdong, Tibet, Gansu, Chengdu, Yunnan…)

I’m glad someone likes me, someone loves me; I’m glad I found my life’s pursuit, my motivation for living; I’m glad I knew very early: the future is every wise decision I make now; and I’m glad I’m extremely “stubborn”, “obstinate”, and even “ruthless”!

This is a “valuable” quality that can survive the end of the world.
