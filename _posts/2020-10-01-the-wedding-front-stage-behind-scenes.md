婚礼这一套私人财产交接程序，台上有人配合表演，台下有人吃瓜看戏，还有人台前幕后，“尔虞我诈”、“裹挟摆布”，真是世态尽显。原本两个人私密的事情，大张旗鼓，被搞成“游街示众”。台下看客，指手画脚，议论纷纷。等待“刽子手”“行刑”，该配合的表演，表演完毕。

台上总不缺沉醉表演当了真的人，会忘记这只是一出演给大家和自己看的好戏。好戏不用演，好戏很快结束。“财产”开始神圣私有，成为面子问题，不再被任何人和其它事物侵犯。“婚姻是爱情的坟墓”这一伏笔，就是从这个时候开始埋下的！

新时代典型的陋习之一，不差了。

The wedding, this set of private property transfer procedures, there are people on stage to cooperate with the performance, there are people under the stage to eat melons and watch the show, and there are people in front of and behind the scenes, “deceiving each other” and “manipulating”, it is really a show of the world. Originally a private matter between two people, it was made into a “public display” with great fanfare. The audience under the stage, pointing fingers and talking, waiting for the “executioner” to “execute”, the performance that should be cooperated, performed.

There are always people on stage who are intoxicated by the performance and forget that this is just a good show for everyone and themselves. A good show does not need to be performed, a good show ends quickly. The “property” begins to be sacred and private, becomes a face issue, and is no longer violated by anyone or anything else. The foreshadowing of “marriage is the grave of love” is buried from this time!

One of the typical bad habits of the new era, not far off.
