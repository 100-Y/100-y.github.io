所有人类，如果一生下来，想要的什么东西，都可以拥有，那么ta们，便不再会闹事。所以，闹事的根本原因，还是变化、有无的一个问题。是初始分配、是政策扶持、是区分对待……是剥削与反抗，更是人性与反人性之间的较量。

\- If all human beings, when they are born, can have whatever they want, then they will no longer make trouble. So, the root cause of the trouble is still a problem of change and possession. It is the initial allocation, the policy support, the differential treatment… It is the exploitation and resistance, and more importantly, the contest between human nature and anti-human nature.

是有情与无义结合的逆子，是思想与理念碰撞出的火花；是推翻一切再来的勇气，是重新定义所有东西的魄力。而不是敬酒不吃吃罚酒，不是与强权说理、与弱者讲同情，……这些都不是。

\- It is the rebellious son of the combination of affection and ruthlessness, it is the spark of the collision of thoughts and ideas; it is the courage to overthrow everything and start again, it is the boldness to redefine everything. And not toasting without eating and drinking as a penalty, not reasoning with power, sympathizing with the weak, … These are not.

不是改谁的命，是改大家的！

\- It’s not about changing someone’s fate, it’s about changing everyone’s!
