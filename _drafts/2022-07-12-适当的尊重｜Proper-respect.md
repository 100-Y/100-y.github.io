世间，每个人都有ta自己，要走的路、该吃的苦……强行安排另一个人的人生，无论怎样，都是在剥夺ta们自由选择的权利。所以“冷漠”就好。冷漠，是对ta人人生，适当的一种尊重。

\- In the world, everyone has their own path to take, their own hardships to endure… Forcing another person’s life, no matter what, is depriving them of their right to choose freely. So “indifference” is good. Indifference is a proper kind of respect for other people’s life.
