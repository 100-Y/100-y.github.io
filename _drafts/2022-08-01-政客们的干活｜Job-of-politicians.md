讲政治、讲立场、以大局为重……

\- Talking about politics, taking a stand, and focusing on the overall situation…

那是政客们的干活，柿子拣软的捏，虚伪又装腔作势。

\- That’s the job of politicians, picking the softest persimmons to squeeze, hypocritical and pretentious.

群众、百姓，不应该成为ta们的附丛。讲爱国，爱的不是ta们；爱的是人民自己。ta们没了，人民自己正好可以取代ta们，成为更好的干活。

\- The masses and the people should not become their appendages. When talking about patriotism, it is not them to love; it is people selves. Without them, people selves just right can replace them and do a better job.
