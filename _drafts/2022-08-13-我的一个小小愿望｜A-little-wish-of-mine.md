“朋友圈里”，所有好友都能正常浏览互联网；都有获得所有免费知识的权利和能力；也都能自由地思考，都有独立的意识。向外，不仅清晰知道ta人的优缺点；对内，同时还能深刻剖析自己。

\- In the “moments”, all friends can browse the Internet normally; they all have the right and ability to acquire all free knowledge; they can also think freely and have independent consciousness. Outwardly, not only do they clearly know the strengths and weaknesses of others; inwardly, they can also deeply analyze themselves.

意识、能力，ta人、自己……有高有低，共性、差异化。都能做自己，也都可以幸福。求同存异，相互尊重；生而平等，死分“高低”。

\- Consciousness, ability, others, oneself… There are highs and lows, commonalities and differences. Everyone can be themselves and can also be happy. Seek common ground while reserving differences, respect each other; born equal, die with “highs and lows”.
