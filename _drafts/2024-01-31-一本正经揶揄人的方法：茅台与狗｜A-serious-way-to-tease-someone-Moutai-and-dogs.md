2024/01/31借道新的话题或内容，各种“抛砖引玉”性质地岔开主旨；然后夹杂实事求是的态度，开展与进行一场欲抑先扬式的阐述和表达。

\- Use a new topic or content to divert the main point, in various ways of "throwing out a brick to attract a jade"; then mix in a realistic attitude, carry out and carry on the statement and expression, raise before then suppress.

以茅台为例。开展：“茅台酒虽好，可狗都不喝。”进行：并罗列出，狗不喝茅台酒的几大原因。

\- Take Moutai as an example. Carry out: "Moutai is good, but dogs don't drink it." Carry on: and list the several reasons why dogs don't drink Moutai.

比如：

\- For example

“狗狗没有喝茅台酒的机会，或者没有喝茅台酒的必要。茅台酒是一种高端的白酒，价格昂贵，市场供不应求，一般用于商务、礼仪、收藏等场合。狗狗作为宠物，一般不会接触到茅台酒，也不需要用茅台酒来表达什么意思。

\- "Dogs don't have the opportunity or the need to drink Moutai. Moutai is a high-end liquor, expensive, in short supply, and generally used for business, etiquette, collection and other occasions. Dogs, as pets, generally don't come into contact with Moutai, nor do they need to use Moutai to express anything.

狗狗对酒精的耐受度很低，喝了酒会对它们的健康造成危害。酒中的乙醇会使狗狗的神经中枢产生先兴奋后抑制的作用，导致呕吐、走路不稳、意识模糊、昏迷甚至死亡。

\- Dogs have a very low tolerance for alcohol, and drinking it can harm their health. The ethanol in the liquor causes the dog's central nervous system to produce a first-excited and then-inhibited effect, leading to vomiting, unstable walking, blurred consciousness, coma or even death.

狗狗对茅台酒的味道可能不感兴趣，或者不适应。茅台酒属于酱香型白酒，味道酸甜苦辣均衡，但也较为浓烈。不同的狗狗可能有不同的口味喜好，有些狗狗可能更喜欢清淡的食物和水。”

\- Dogs may not be interested in or accustomed to the taste of Moutai. Moutai belongs to the sauce-flavored liquor, with a balanced taste of sour, sweet, bitter and spicy, but also quite strong. Different dogs may have different taste preferences, some dogs may prefer light food and water.”

当然，喝惯茅台酒的特殊狗种，除外。（这话说完，没有后招就赶紧溜吧，即使喝酒的是蠢人，都会觉得自己受到了冒犯，这步几乎属于是“伤敌一千自损八百”的冒进棋了。）

\- Of course, except for the special breeds of dogs that are used to drinking Moutai. (After saying this, run away quickly, even if the drinker is a fool, they will feel offended, this step is almost a reckless move of "hurting the enemy by a thousand and self-damaging by eight hundred".)
