负面效应：

\- Negative effects

备战的大背景之下，政策与行动、监管，相结合的一个类似“人民公社”的现代产物。

\- Under the background of preparing for war, a modern product similar to the “People’s Commune” is combined with policies, actions, and supervision.

正面宣传：

\- Positive propaganda:

退林还耕运动，是指将占用耕地的林地、草地、园地等其它农用地及农业设施建设用地，根据实际情况，稳妥审慎处理，逐步引导恢复为耕地的政策。这一政策是为了保护和增加耕地资源，稳定粮食生产，应对全球性的粮食危机。出于生态和经济的考虑，而不是军事。备战，是基于错误的假设，没有任何事实依据。

\- The movement of returning forests to farms refers to the policy of gradually guiding the restoration of farmland occupied by forests, grasslands, gardens and other agricultural land and land for agricultural facilities construction according to actual conditions and prudent handling. This policy is to protect and increase arable land resources, stabilize grain production, and respond to the global food crisis. It is based on ecological and economic considerations rather than military. Preparing for war is based on erroneous assumptions and has no factual basis.

而农管，也正是应运“这一时代需求”，而配套产生的一项服务和管理。

\- And agricultural management is also a service and management that has emerged in response to the “needs of this era”.
