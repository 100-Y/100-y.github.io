2023/09/08“医院”：是救死扶伤的“红十字会”；也是谋财害命洞门大开的“地狱入口”。其中，很大一部分盲从、想不开与怕死、找死，心理的“蠢人”，给这所“服务人民性质”的医院，充当充分燃烧材料，为其攫取最后最大的利润价值，提供了千载难逢与无与伦比的机会。

\- “Hospital”: it is a “Red Cross” that saves lives and heals wounds; it is also a “hell entrance” that door is wide open to harm people and make money. Among them, a large part of blind, depressed and suicidal, and fearful and reckless, mentally “stupid people”, serve as sufficient fuels, for this hospital of “the nature of serving the people”, providing it with a rare and unparalleled opportunity, to seize the final and maximum profit value.
