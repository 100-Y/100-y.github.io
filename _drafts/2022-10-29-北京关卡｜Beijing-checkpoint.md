梦到刚来北京城，大街上秩序井然，出行全靠设置的关卡分流，人们各自遵循固定的线路。

\- Dreamed that first came to Beijing City, the streets were Orderly, all travel depended on Setpoints and Diversions, and people each followed Fixed Routes.

我来去自如，变换不同的身位，辗转腾挪，抵达一个无名查验核酸检测报告的另一个关卡。被截留让拿出相关码，却稀里糊涂想到定位的同时发朋友圈，确认现在的地点，以回到初始的位置。可无论如何打不开……

\- I Come and Go Freely, changing positions, tossing and turning, and arriving at an unnamed another checkpoint for checking the Nucleic Acid Test Report. Intercepted and asked to take out the Relevant Code, but confusedly thought of Posting a wechat moment while locating, Confirm the Current Location to return to Original. But no matter what, it can’t open…

就这样陷入僵局。身后一名已经等很久有点不耐烦的朋友，指着我的手机屏幕说：今天星期天，股市不开的！你怕不是在做白日梦，想屁吃？我恍然大悟：莫不是自己真的在做梦？

\- So it’s deadlocked. A Friend behind who had been waiting for a long time and was a little impatient, pointed to the screen of my mobile phone and said: Today’s Sunday, the stock market is not open! Are you Daydreaming, wanting to eat farts? It dawned on me: Could it be that I was really dreaming?

于是到这里，就梦醒了！期间，间杂了一些其它的梦：对楼消失的妇女，独特人行天桥的构造。

\- So here, I woke up! During dreaming period, some other dreams were interspersed: The opposite building Disappearing Woman, A unique Pedestrian Bridge construction.
