微博的清零派和封控爱好者，都在看胡锡进出笑话，嘲讽，甚至巴不得他送死。好让封控政策回到，11月时候的状态。这与唐飞（躺匪，微博对立术语）又称放开派，截然不同。

\- The Zero-Clearers and Containment Enthusiasts of Weibo are all watching Hu Xijin make jokes and sarcasm, even wish him to death. So that the Containment Policy can return to the state in November. This is completely different from the Tang Fei (躺匪, an opposite term on Weibo), also known as the Faction of Liberalisation.

前者认为，是唐飞们上街，举白纸等，造成了如今这样的局面。实则是，当局直接颁布的命令，所致。爱好者知道谁是爹，惹不起于是只好拿支持放开的胡锡进等，撒气。

\- The former believes that it is the Tang Feis who took to the streets and held up blank papers and so on, which caused the current situation. In fact, it was orders issued directly by the government authorities. Enthusiasts know who the father is, and they can’t afford to offend them, so they have to vent their anger on Hu Xijin who supports liberalisation.

解决如今的恐慌、矛盾，也很是简单。就是鼓励爱好者，也能勇敢上街，举黑纸。提出ta们对应的诉求。好让政策继续转向。来回折腾，体现民主最佳的典范。

\- It is also very simple to solve today’s panic and contradiction. That is encourage the enthusiasts, can also bravely take to the streets and hold up black paper. Put forward their corresponding demands. So that the policy continues to turn. Tossing back and forth, reflects the best example of democracy.

不过在当局的眼里，以前唐飞们是行走的50万，现在变成爱好者了。

\- However, in the eyes of the government authorities, the Tang Feis used to be the 500,000¥ walking people, Now are the Enthusiasts.
