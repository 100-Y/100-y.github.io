梦见两人走在一条城市熟悉道路的两边，高楼建筑都推倒成为了桑田。

\- In the dream, two people walked on either side of a familiar city road, and the tall buildings were all demolished into mulberry fields.

天色暗淡，一道道耀眼的白色闪电，劈头盖脸的锤下来。找不到躲藏之地，只能惊恐万分地跳跃、逃亡。好不容易，找到一处闲置的房屋，闪电不停地劈打。掏出手机，才发现忘了开飞行模式。

\- The sky was dark, and dazzling white lightning struck down relentlessly. With no place to hide, we could only jump and flee in terror. Finally, we found an idle house, but the lightning kept striking. I took out my phone and realized that I had forgotten to turn on airplane mode.

隔天，路上太多被雷劈成两半，烧焦了的穿着军服的军人肢体。偶尔遇见一些寻人的路过。

\- The next day, there were too many soldiers in military uniforms on the road who had been struck by lightning and burned in half. Occasionally, some people passed by looking for someone.

突然，一个日本的士兵出现，他说：趁上级还没下达命令之前，请你们尽快离开仓库重地。

\- Sudden, a Japanese soldier appeared and he said: Before the superiors issue orders, please leave the warehouse area as soon as possible.
