总有一些“无脑子”，天真且肆意地认为，疫情突然又变得严重，是因为不再坚持动态清零政策的缘故。将一切原因归咎于，不配合的人群。而压根不去探讨：疫苗、核酸、方舱等，内部人为制造谋取自身前（钱）途的因素；以及国际、整个大环境的外部影响。

\- There are always some “brainless” who naively and recklessly think that The epidemic suddenly became serious again, because of the Dynamic zeroing policy was no longer insisted on. Blame all the reasons on the uncooperative crowd. And do not discuss at all: vaccines, nucleic acids, shelters, etc., internal artificially created factors to seek one’s own future (money); as well as the external influence of the international and the entire environment.

不过是：一边攘外必先安内；一边玩瞒天过海、先礼后兵的把戏。决绝，这些被人心操弄的傀儡，没有一个，会有好的下场。

\- It’s just: while fighting against the outside world, must first defend inside country; while playing the tricks of deception and polite first then soldiers. Absolutely, none of these puppets manipulated by people’s hearts will end well.
