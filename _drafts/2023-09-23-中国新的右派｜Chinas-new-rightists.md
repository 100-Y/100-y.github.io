2023/09/23对比毛时代的“反右运动”，中国如今新的“右派”，包含哪些群体？  
  
\- Compared to the “Anti-Rightist Movement” of the Maoist era, what groups are included in China’s new “rightists” today?  
  
中国的“右派”一词随着时间的变化，其含义和范围也发生了变化。在毛泽东时代， “反右派运动”主要针对的是知识分子、作家、记者、学者等对共产党的批评者，他们被指控倾向于资本主义、民主或自由主义，而不是社会主义和毛泽东思想。他们中的许多人被送往劳改营、监狱或偏远地区进行“再教育”。  
  
\- The term “rightists” in China has changed its meaning and scope over time. In the Maoist era, the “Anti-Rightist Movement” targeted mainly intellectuals, writers, journalists, scholars, and other critics of the Communist Party who were accused of favoring capitalism, democracy, or liberalism over socialism and Maoism. Many of them were sent to labor camps, prisons, or remote areas for “re-education”.  
  
今天，中国的新“右派”不仅限于以上知识分子等，还包括各种群体和个人，他们挑战党对权力、意识形态和信息的垄断。他们可能主张人权、民主、法治、宗教自由、民族自治、环境保护或市场改革。他们也可能在社交媒体上表达不同意见，参与抗议或民间社会组织，或揭露当局的腐败或滥用。  
  
\- Today, China’s new “rightists” are not limited to intellectuals, but also include various groups and individuals who challenge the party’s monopoly on power, ideology, and information. They may advocate for human rights, democracy, rule of law, religious freedom, ethnic autonomy, environmental protection, or market reforms. They may also express dissenting opinions on social media, join protests or civil society organizations, or expose corruption or abuses by the authorities.  
  
这些群体和个人面临着中国当局的各种迫害，如审查、骚扰、恐吓、拘留、酷刑、监禁或强迫失踪。政府也试图通过利用其经济和外交影响力，向外国政府、公司、大学和媒体机构施压，使其服从其要求。  
  
\- These groups and individuals face various forms of persecution by the Chinese authorities, such as censorship, harassment, intimidation, detention, torture, imprisonment, or forced disappearance. The government also tries to silence their voices abroad by using its economic and diplomatic influence to pressure foreign governments, companies, universities, and media outlets to comply with its demands.
