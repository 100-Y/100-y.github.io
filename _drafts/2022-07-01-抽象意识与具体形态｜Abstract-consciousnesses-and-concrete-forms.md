搞不懂那些为政府、党派、国家等抽象意识，讲话人的思维。就如同，理不清一帮替人民、群众等具体形态，尽心报道的团体，一样。

\- Don’t understand the thinking of those, who speak for the government, parties, countries and other abstract consciousnesses. Just like, can’t sort out a bunch of groups, who report diligently for the people, the masses and other concrete forms.
