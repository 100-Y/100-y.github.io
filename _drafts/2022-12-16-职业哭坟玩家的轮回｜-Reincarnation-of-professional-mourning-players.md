以前，写日记的方方；便是如今，继续支持封控的爱好者，打个比方。不同的是，以前的普通人们发不出声，没有自己写日记的渠道；现在，除了可以写各式各样的小作文不被随意删除，还有了一定参与和知情的权益。

\- In the past, the Fang Fang who wrote a diary; is now, the Enthusiasts who continue to support the Containment, for example. The difference is that ordinary people used to be unable to speak out, and did not have their own channel to write a diary; today, in addition to being able to write all kinds of small essays and not be deleted at will, there is also have some right to participate and be informed.

这就是最大成功的改变。

\- And this is the most successful change.
