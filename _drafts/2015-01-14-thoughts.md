没有思想的人是可怕的，ta会把ta家族的思想，带到、强行灌输与你。告诉你怎样的妻子或是丈夫才是好样的，怎样的婚姻结合才能幸福。

有思想的人是可怕的，ta会把ta自己学到、了解的思想，带到、影响给你。告诉你怎样的妻子或是丈夫才是好样的，怎样的婚姻结合才能幸福。

两个没有思想的人结合，将会毁坏一个家庭；两个有思想的，则会拯救第三个。有思想、没有思想，都一样，被影响而产生影响；他们又不同，一个主动，一个被动，如是而已。

People without thoughts are terrible, they will bring their family’s thoughts, to you, and force them on you. They tell you what kind of wife or husband is good, what kind of marriage can be happy.

People with thoughts are terrible, they will bring their own learned and understood thoughts, to you, and influence you. They tell you what kind of wife or husband is good, what kind of marriage can be happy.

Two people without thoughts will destroy a family; two people with thoughts will save a third. With or without thoughts, they are the same, influenced and influencing; they are different, one active, one passive, that’s all.
