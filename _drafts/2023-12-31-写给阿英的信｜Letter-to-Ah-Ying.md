2023/12/31写给阿英的信（2023-12-31 15:00）

\- Letter to Ah Ying

有些准备好的话给你说，赶在新的一年到来之前。希望你有耐心看下去。打扰或是冒犯的地方，还望你见谅；你臭骂我一顿，删除好友也行。

\- I have some prepared words to tell you, just before the new year arrives. I hope you have the patience to read on. If there are any disturbances or offenses, I hope you can forgive me; you can scold me, or even delete me as a friend.

可能这是我最后一次给你发信息，可能不久的以后我也会主动将你删除好友。但在这些不受我限制的事，发生之前，我仍有相当多的一些话要给你说：

\- This might be the last time I send you a message, and I might soon take the initiative to delete you as a friend. But before these things, which are not restricted by me, happen, I still have quite a lot of words to tell you:

第一、

\- First,

请我吃饭以及见面的事，还算数么？如果都不做数了，新的一年，邀请你来我家里做客。缓事从急。我好想你，阿英，不止想你。

\- Does the matter of inviting me to dinner and meeting still count? If not, I invite you to visit my home in the new year. I miss you so much, Ah Ying, more than just missing you.

第二、

\- Second,

我想过和你在一起，但后来觉得你没那么个意思。彩礼等其它一些比较麻烦的事情，不是没法解决。但是，两情相悦的事，我一个人总是无法勉强的。

\- I have thought about being with you, but later felt that you didn’t mean that. Dowry and other troublesome matters are not insolvable. However, the matter of mutual affection, I can’t force it alone.

第三、

\- Third,

我自认为要比其他很多名不副实的人，许多方面，优秀很多；我也深知自身的缺点。但这，并不就意味，我是一个自以为是，没有廉耻或底线的人。

\- I consider myself to be much better than many other people who are not as good as they seem in many ways; I am also well aware of my shortcomings. But this does not mean that I am a self-righteous person without shame or bottom line.

第四、

\- Fourth,

对于人生命题的各项选择，我始终相信，不留遗憾。也一直相信，一开始就遇见的那个阿英你。

\- For all the choices of life’s propositions, I always believe in leaving no regrets. I also always believe in the Ah Ying you that I met at the beginning.

第五、

\- Fifth,

为此，我是相当认真且知道需要付出怎么样的一些代价。而这些，都在我能承受的范围之内。

\- For this, I am quite serious and know what kind of price I need to pay. And all these are within my capacity.

最后，以上这些，都将作为“写诗人”，某个对于一段时间内的美好经历与回忆的见证，写进文字里，永久性地镌刻与铭记。还望你理解

\- Finally, all of the above will be written into words as a “poet”, a witness to a beautiful experience and memory for a period of time, permanently engraved and remembered. I hope you understand.

差点忘了，第六点，也是最重要的一点：

\- Almost forgot, the sixth point, which is also the most important one:

你是自由的，我无意塑造任何不自由部分的ta人。我谨代表自己，“塑造自由的我”。

\- You are free, I have no intention of shaping any unfree part of others. I represent myself, “shaping the free me”.
