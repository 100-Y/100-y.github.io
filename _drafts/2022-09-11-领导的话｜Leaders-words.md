领导的话，搁一些人眼里，就跟放屁一样。也就手下的人，听得最仔细、执行起来最认真。无论怎样的“令”（话），只要能让领导开心、满意，昧着良心都要将事情做好、做得更好。领导成了ta们的衣食父母，ta们虽心里不甘、情也不愿，但还是成了领导的跑腿。

\- The leader’s words, in some people’s eyes, are like farts. Only the subordinates listen carefully and execute earnestly. No matter what kind of “order” (words), as long as they can make the leader happy and satisfied, they will do things well and better, even if they go against their conscience. The leader has become their breadwinner, they are unwilling and reluctant in their hearts, but they still become the leader’s errand boy.

领导又说：“我是人民的儿子”，“我将全心全意为人民服务”。

\- The leader also says: “I am the son of the people”, “I will serve the people wholeheartedly”.
