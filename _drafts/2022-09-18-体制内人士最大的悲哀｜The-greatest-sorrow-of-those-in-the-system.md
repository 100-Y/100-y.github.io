系统，对体制内人士的监控（剥削），社会人士远不及ta们。每个人都要求务必是保密的工具人。身在其中，衷心、听令，便是唯一的正确。

\- The system, monitors (exploits) those within the system, far more than it does ordinary people. Everyone is required to be a confidential tool. Being sincere and obedient is the only right thing to do while being within.

百姓，不拥戴ta们；机关、上级，更是不给好脸色。头上时刻悬着一把无比锋利的刀剑。ta们，不仅要非常谨言慎行，还得随时听候差遣。ta们，做不了真正的自己，只能心不甘情不愿，被裹挟着走完自己牛马的大半生。

\- The common people do not support them, and their superiors do not treat them kindly. A sharp sword hangs over their heads at all times. They must be extremely cautious in their words and actions, and be ready to serve at any time. They cannot be their true selves, but are reluctantly dragged along for most of their lives.

直到脱离系统，才具备自己独立思考的能力。ta们不是没有，是系统不准许有。与其说是，系统的错；不如讲，是构成这个系统（通用、宽泛意）所有成员的。

\- It is only after leaving the system that they have the ability to think independently. It’s not that they don’t have it, it’s that the system doesn’t allow it. Rather than saying it’s the fault of the system, it’s better to say it’s the fault of all members who make up this system (in a general and broad sense).

这，便是ta们最大的悲哀。

\- And this, is the greatest sorrow of them.
