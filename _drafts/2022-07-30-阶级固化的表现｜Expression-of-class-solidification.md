当官的不敢去建功立业，却鼓吹听话的将士们送死。口上说着是自己的地，却压根不敢学佩洛西们登岛。这便是，阶级固化，人与人之间的差别。

\- Officials who dare not make achievements, but advocate sending obedient soldiers to their deaths. They say it is their own land, but they dare not learn from Pelosi and others to land on the island. This is the difference between class solidification and people. This is not even Pelosi’s land!
