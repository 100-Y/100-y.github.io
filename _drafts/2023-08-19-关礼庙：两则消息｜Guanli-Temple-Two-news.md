2023/08/19“关礼庙”，在举办天下第一届英雄竞技大赛，各路神仙、凡人一同参加，共百人，50组，两两抽签，一一决胜。“林荆”率先出场，可出场前，庙观发生了一个小小插曲：每一组参加比赛的英雄，都需要先到庙观下信息不明的民居，按照规定时间内，先获取两则关键的消息。

\- “Guanli Temple” is holding the first world hero competition, with all kinds of gods and mortals participating, a total of 100 people, 50 groups, drawing lots, and deciding the winner one by one. “Lin Jing” took the lead in appearing, but before appearing, a small episode happened in the temple: each group of heroes participating in the competition needs to go to the unknown residence under the temple first, and get two key news within the specified time.

“林荆”，第一个飞了出去。民居四处无人，好不容找到一家，却是一对境况悲惨的母子。看似母亲正在教育“自闭”当中的儿子，好好吃饭。见此种场景，“林荆”，毫无顾虑上前，充满耐心似地帮助化解。

\- “Lin Jing” flew out first. There was no one around the residence, and he finally found a family, but it was a mother and son with a miserable situation. It seemed that the mother was educating her “autistic” son to eat well. Seeing this scene, “Lin Jing” stepped forward without hesitation, patiently helping to resolve.

林荆：“关礼庙”，在举办天下第一届英雄竞技大赛，各路神仙、凡人一同参加。你们赶紧上去看看吧！

\- Lin Jing: “Guanli Temple” is holding the first world hero competition, with all kinds of gods and mortals participating. You hurry up and take a look!

“自闭”当中的小孩，突然开口：牛儿吃，马儿跑。快的牛儿马儿有人喜欢，太快的牛儿马儿害死了自己。牛儿吃，马儿跑。开口讲人话的牛儿马儿，成为怪物。闷声吃和跑的牛儿马儿，活到了最后。

\- The “autistic” child suddenly opened his mouth: Cows eat, horses run. Fast cows and horses are liked by people, too fast cows and horses kill themselves. Cows eat, horses run. Cows and horses that speak human words become monsters. Cows and horses that eat and run silently live to the end.

时间到，故事正式开始。“林荆”，被自动传送回对战的擂台。

\- Time is up, the story officially begins. “Lin Jing” was automatically transferred back to the arena of the duel.
