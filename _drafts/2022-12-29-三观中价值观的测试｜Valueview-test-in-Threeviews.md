如何简单判断一个人，是否：境外势力还是爱国、间谍还是家暴男，汉奸、走狗还是红卫兵、义和团等（引申义）。试试多次当面，指出ta们，以及ta们所引以为傲事业的缺点，然后看ta们的反应。

\- How to simply judge a person, whether it is Foreign Force or Patriotic, Spy or Domestic Violence Man, Traitor, Running Dog or Red Guards, Boxers, etc (Extending meanings). Try face-to-face many times, point out the shortcomings of them and their proud Career, and then see their reactions.

急了，说明可能是。急了还辩护说不是，那么多半是。急了辩护不说，还打骂人，那100%肯定是了。

\- Annoyed, the explanation might be. Annoyed and defended saying no, then most likely. Annoyed, defended saying no, beat and scold people, that is 100% sure.

归根结底：某个人无知和ta选择承不承认的一个判定。

\- In the final analysis: A judgment that a certain person’s Ignorance and chooses to admit or not.
