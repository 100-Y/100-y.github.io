从毛泽东开始，新中国每一代行政官员任内，都会主动著书立说：提出自己特色的语录和见解。用以：对应天时，优良传承，彰显时代，彪炳后世。上行下效，从古至今。也算是我国官场文学独有的一种创作形式。

\- Starting from Mao Zedong, every generation of administrative officials in New China will take the initiative to write books and make speeches during their tenure: put forward their own distinctive quotations and opinions. To: correspond to the times, inherit the good, highlight the era, and make a mark for future generations. Top-down, from ancient times to the present. It can also be regarded as a unique form of creation in our country’s officialdom literature.

唱赞歌的程度，是ta们唯一的区别。

\- The degree of singing praises is the only difference between them.
