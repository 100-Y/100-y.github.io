我本可以独自忍受一个人的黑暗，奈何有个爱我的人让我期待着自己能够给她带来光明。 我悔恨难当，生前愧对爱我的她；我无语凝噎，也曾执意想要结束自己的生命。可后来，我想通了，最终选择隐入城市的尘烟。

\- I could have endured the darkness alone, but there was someone who loved me and made me hope that I could bring her light. I regret it so much, I failed her who loved me in my life; I was speechless, I once wanted to end my life. But later, I figured it out and finally chose to hide in the dust of the city.

自始至终，电影中被嫌弃和极具悲剧色彩的人物， 只有一人。女主。不仅被原生家庭，嫌弃、打骂，被周围所有人骂“糟货”、瘟神，也被丈夫嫌弃，直到死亡的时候，都没能亲眼看到丈夫的忏悔。怎样来到这个世界，便怎样以一个凄惨的方式离去。

\- From beginning to end, there was only one person in the movie who was despised and tragic, the female protagonist. She was not only rejected and beaten by her original family, but also scolded by everyone around her as “trash” and “plague”. She was also despised by her husband, and she never saw his repentance before she died. She came to this world and left in a miserable way.

要问，这世界，这中国，还有没有这样贫苦、凄惨的百姓，答案是肯定有的。因病返贫，因为残疾、其它各种原因，再度穷苦的。有，且不少。城里人，因为癌症花掉一家积蓄背上债务，有的。有人，救命的钱存银行里取不出来，也有。甚者取钱还要被白衣人士殴打；就连救死扶伤的医生，为了金钱也能出卖自己灵魂。无意或有意导致的不幸和穷苦，太多太多了。还不提，那些角落里隐藏，没被发现的。

\- To ask, if there are such poor and miserable people in this world, in this China, the answer is definitely yes. There are many people who are poor again due to illness, disability, or other reasons. There are people in the city who spend their family’s savings on cancer and get into debt. There are people who can’t get their money out of the bank to save their lives. Some even get beaten by white-clothed people when they withdraw money; even doctors who save lives and heal wounds can sell their souls for money. There are too many misfortunes and poverty caused by unintentional or intentional reasons. Not to mention those hidden in the corners that have not been discovered.

电影最大的意义便在于此吧，当然，没有这部影片，“意义”也丝毫不为影响。毕竟现实，不停滚动播出的每一帧，都比电影要更深刻十倍、百倍。

\- The greatest significance of the movie lies in this, I guess. Of course, without this movie, “significance” would not be affected at all. After all, reality, every frame that is constantly rolling out, is more profound than movies ten times or a hundred times.
