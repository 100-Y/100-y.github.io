曾几何时，大陆和台湾地区两岸人民，共同联合起来，征讨“菲律宾海岸警卫队杀害台湾渔民”事件……后来，换了一批批政客，人民也好像跟着换了似的。一些人民被教育成了，政客们的枪；一些人民，也不再是当年，那个义愤填膺、正义凛然的模样！  
  
\- Once upon a time, people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, mainland China and Taiwan, jointly united to condemn the “Philippine Coast Guard killing Taiwanese fishermen” incident… Later, a batch of politicians changed, and the people seemed to have changed as well. Some people were educated to become the guns of politicians; some people were no longer the righteous and indignant appearance of that year!
