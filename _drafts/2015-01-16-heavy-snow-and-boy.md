初三十点下晚自习，一个飘着鹅毛大雪寒冷的冬天，有个少年迈着小步奔跑在回家的路上。少年幻想拥有一辆自己的脚踏车，用脚蹬便不会感觉寒冷。

After the evening self-study at 10 o’clock in the third year of junior high school, on a cold winter day with goose feather snowflakes, a teenager ran home in small steps. The teenager fantasized about having his own bicycle, and he wouldn’t feel cold if he pedaled with his feet.
