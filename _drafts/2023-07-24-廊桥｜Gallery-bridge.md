在黑暗中寻找方向的人，或许可以借助那些微弱而坚定的光芒。它们虽然不足以照亮整个世界，却能让我们看清自己的脚步。就像那些在水面上闪烁的星星，它们虽然遥不可及，却能让我们感受到生命的奇迹。

\- Those who are looking for direction in the dark, may be able to rely on those faint and firm lights. They are not enough to illuminate the whole world, but they can let us see our own steps. Just like those stars that sparkle on the water, they are out of reach, but they can make us feel the miracle of life.
