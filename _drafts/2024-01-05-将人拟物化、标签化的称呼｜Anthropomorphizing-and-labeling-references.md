2024/01/05“小土豆”等将人拟物化、标签化的自我称呼，是自嘲还是现实中对于同类群体擅作主张的贬低？“小土豆”的ta人称呼，有无侮辱的性质存在，尤其在个人或群体未经同意，ta人便自以为是地进行一个通用的广泛称呼。

\- Is the anthropomorphizing and labeling self-references such as 'little potato' a form of self-deprecation or a derogatory assertion on similar groups in reality? Does the 'other' references in 'little potato' carry any insulting implications, especially when it is used as a general, widespread reference without the consent of the individual or group?
