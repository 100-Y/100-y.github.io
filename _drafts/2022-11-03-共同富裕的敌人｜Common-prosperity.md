共同富裕最大的阶级敌人是？掌权的无产阶级。

\- The biggest class enemy of common prosperity is? The ruling proletariat.

比如，“真心”为人民服务与回馈社会却隐瞒、转移自身资产的官员和商人；比如，打着共富旗号，借力谋取ta人合法利益的普通百姓。志愿者、积极分子、打手等等……

\- For example, officials and businessmen who “sincerely” serve the people and give back to the society but conceal and transfer their own assets; for example, ordinary people who seek to take advantage of others’ legitimate interests under the banner of common prosperity. Volunteers, activists, thugs, etc.

共同富裕：表面上是削弱资本家，本质上却是消灭无产阶级。共同富裕一开始的提出，就意味着错误，其分别对应的是单个与贫穷。它们，不该是对立的。顺应自然的口号，应当是，一开始的所有和结束时候的无。没有原始累积，更没有继承的过程。只不过，一个出生与死亡的一个无限循环。

\- Common prosperity: On the surface, it weakens the capitalists, but in essence it eliminates the proletariat. The proposal of common prosperity from the beginning means a mistake, which corresponds to the individual and poverty respectively. They should not be opposed. The slogan that conforms to nature should be, all at the beginning and none at the end. There is no primitive accumulation, nor inheritance process. It’s just an infinite cycle of birth and death.
