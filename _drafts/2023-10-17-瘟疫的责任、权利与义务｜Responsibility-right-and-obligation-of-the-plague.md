2023/10/17羊出的毛，织成衣物盖在人身上；不仅羊毛卖不了一分钱，羊还得定期向修理工人支付“380元的修理费用”。  
  
\- The wool from the sheep, woven into clothes to cover the human body; not only the wool can not sell for a penny, but the sheep also have to pay the repairman “380 yuan of repair costs” regularly.  
  
遭瘟的病羊改善生活，一定是修理工人大发善心，自掏腰包医好了羊，同时变相免了“380元的修理费用”。  
  
\- The sick sheep who suffered from the plague improved their lives, it must be that the repairman was very kind, paid out of his own pocket to cure the sheep, and at the same time indirectly exempted the “380 yuan of repair costs”.  
  
工人不说：自掏腰包里的钱怎么来的，以及“380元的修理费用”又去到了哪里。  
  
\- The worker did not say: where did the money in his own pocket come from, and where did the “380 yuan of repair costs” go.  
  
工人只是不断在重复性质地强调谈话：“依法缴纳”！治理羊瘟和改善生活的费用和花费，是羊群里每一只羊都应该尽到的义务和都能享受到的权利。  
  
\- The worker just kept repeating the nature of the emphatic talk: “pay according to law”! The cost and expenditure of controlling the sheep plague and improving their lives are obligation that every sheep in the flock should fulfill and right that they can enjoy.  
  
于是，羊瘟治理的责任，就这样不断被摊派到每一只羊身上。  
  
\- Therefore, the responsibility of controlling the sheep plague was constantly apportioned to every sheep.  
  
这一转移和混淆“责任、权利和义务”手段的做法，在于通过宣传“瘟疫”，再通过“羊瘟的治理”，根本在于：“带了瘟疫的羊”。  
  
\- This method of transferring and confusing “responsibility, right and obligation”, is to propagate the “plague”, then through the “control of the sheep plague”, and fundamentally to: “the sheep that brought the plague”.  
  
其中，工人攫取羊群大量收益的同时，推掉了原本责任。部分羊享受到了所谓权利。而羊群，作为付出的代价，集体成为了那个义务。  
  
\- Among them, while the worker seized a large amount of income from the flock, shirked original responsibility. Some sheep enjoyed the so-called right. And the flock, as the price of paying, collectively became that obligation.
