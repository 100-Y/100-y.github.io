2016年，甘肃西和礼县寺庙考察之行归来，租房，被成都本地一家新起的二手代理租房公司（优客逸家），欺骗办理了贷款租房的合同，类似后来爆雷的蛋壳公寓的代理模式。  
  
\- In 2016, after returning from a temple survey trip in Xiheli County, Gansu, I rented a house and was deceived by a newly established second-hand rental agency company (Youkeyijia) in Chengdu to sign a loan rental contract, similar to the agency model of the later exploded Danke Apartment.  
  
后来，一段时间稳定之后，成都，省图书馆。借书与还书期间，在监控眼皮下面，丢失了一辆14年买的，满级装配的21速捷安特山地自行车。  
  
\- Later, after a period of stability, Chengdu, Provincial Library. During the borrowing and returning of books, under the eyelids of the monitor, I lost a 14-year-old, fully equipped 21-speed Giant mountain bike.  
  
报警，做笔录，查监控，不耐烦，后期毫无任何通知与结果。从此，去派出所，再没了往日添加的任何滤镜，而是一改一副趾高气扬的老油条姿态。  
  
\- Report to the police, make a record, check the monitor, impatient, no notification or result in the later period. Since then, I went to the police station and never added any filters as before, but instead changed to a arrogant and old-fashioned attitude.  
  
出了派出所，在周围的地方，闲逛了一周。觉得不是个事儿，然后下午顺道走一趟出版大厦，想要咨询出版一本整理差不多的古籍。  
  
\- Out of the police station, I wandered around for a week. I didn’t think it was a big deal, so I went to the Publishing House in the afternoon and wanted to consult about publishing an ancient book that was almost sorted out.  
  
整栋大厦，跑了几乎所有的出版社，只有两家有意询问了一番，一家是巴蜀书社，都是年轻的刚入职的同龄小伙。  
  
\- The entire building ran almost all the publishing houses, only two of them asked some questions with interest, one was Bashu Publishing House, all young colleagues who had just joined the job.  
  
印象最深的，是处于五六层的文艺出版社，还是其它什么的公司。被里面的一个副总编辑骂了，说是没有敲门，急冲冲地，惊扰到了在办公室里睡觉的，他的小儿子。  
  
\- The most impressive thing was the Literary and Art Publishing House or some other company on the fifth or sixth floor. I was scolded by a deputy editor-in-chief inside, saying that I didn’t knock on the door and rushed in, disturbing his son who was sleeping in the office.  
  
当时我道歉了。丢了早上出发的山地车，只能郁闷的换乘公交回到出租房。  
  
\- I apologized at the time. I lost my mountain bike when I set off in the morning and could only take the bus back to the rental house.  
  
我到现在，都还深刻记着那天，发生了的大致一天的经历。  
  
\- I still remember deeply until now, what happened that day.  
  
那是我独自呆在成都两年，为数不多的阴暗日子。丢失心爱的代步自行车，还莫名被人欺负了一顿。  
  
\- That was one of the few dark days when I stayed alone in Chengdu for two years. I lost my beloved bicycle and was inexplicably bullied.  
  
直到后来不久，又重新买了现在还在骑的公路车，才又重新找回当时在成都到处闲游的快乐日子。  
  
\- It wasn’t until later that I bought the road bike that I’m still riding now, and then I found back the happy days of wandering around Chengdu.
