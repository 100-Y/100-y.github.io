谁在编史？谁在删句？在胜利者的笔下，忠诚与背叛常常易位，不是因为道德模糊，而是因为历史的舞台从未平坦。如果和平得以书写，是否战争便成为罪孽？如果投降换来完整，是否坚持才是毁灭的开端？汪精卫的胜败，不只是一个人的命运，而是整个评价体系的镜像倒转。 动摇的不是真相，而是谁有权述说。

Who writes history? Who deletes the lines? In the pen of the victor, loyalty and betrayal often switch places—not because morality is unclear, but because the stage of history has never been level. If peace can be written, does that make war a sin? If surrender brings wholeness, does resistance become the seed of ruin? The fate of Wang Jingwei is more than one man’s fortune—it is a mirrored reversal of an entire system of judgment. A shift not in truth, but in who gets to tell it.
