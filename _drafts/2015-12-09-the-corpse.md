没有思想，躺坐在床上  
就好比死后被安置在棺材。  
虽拉拢帘布却保证纱窗开启。  
尸体不会说它有灵魂，  
灵魂已经飘飞，  
尸体不会说它有思想。

- Without thoughts, lying or sitting on the bed
- Is like being placed in a coffin after death.
- Although the curtains are drawn, the screens are kept open.
- Corpse won’t say it has a soul,
- Soul has already flown away,
- The corpse won’t say it has thoughts.
