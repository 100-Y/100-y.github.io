现在所正遭受的，大是由自己，以后或是先前，应该得到或是已经得到，需要付出、收获的因果律决定。也就是说，以后或是先前，得到或是付出的越多，这种处境就越尴尬；相反就越淡然。

What you are suffering now is largely determined by the law of cause and effect that you should have or have already received, or need to pay or reap, in the future or in the past. That is to say, the more you get or give in the future or in the past, the more awkward this situation will be; the opposite will be more indifferent.
