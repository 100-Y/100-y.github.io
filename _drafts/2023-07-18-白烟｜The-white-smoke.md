故事发生在一家乡村年龄相差15来岁的堂兄妹身上。

\- The story takes place between two cousins who are 15 years apart in age in a rural area.

故事的开头是这样的。一天凌晨的早上，堂兄起床，不知为何爬到平房的楼顶，发现周围四处别家的烟囱，不约而同冒起数额总量过百的白烟，由远及近，由大变小，由浓的上升巨柱演变为轻薄的漂浮缕带，再逐渐形成巨柱。

\- The story begins like this. One early morning, the cousin got up and climbed to the roof of the flat house for some reason. He found that the chimneys of other houses around him were simultaneously emitting white smoke in a total amount of over a hundred, from far to near, from large to small, from thick rising pillars to thin floating ribbons, and gradually forming pillars again.

堂兄仿佛预感到了什么。

接着是一阵雷声、雨声。

\- The cousin seemed to have a premonition of something.  
\- Then there was a sound of thunder and rain.

堂哥来到楼顶边缘，继续观察临近烟囱的变化，睡梦中的堂妹也被雷声吵醒，爬上堂哥所在位置的楼梯。堂哥被远处和近处什么吹来的东西击倒，在白烟和雨滴的交接发展过程中，被束缚住。堂妹发现挣扎的堂哥想要上前施救，堂哥赶紧大声呼喊逃跑。

\- The cousin came to the edge of the roof and continued to observe the changes in the nearby chimney. The cousin who was sleeping was also awakened by the thunder and climbed up the stairs to where the cousin was. The cousin was knocked down by something blown from afar and nearby, and was bound during the development of the white smoke and raindrops. The cousin saw the struggling cousin and wanted to come forward to rescue him, but the cousin quickly shouted to run away.

令堂哥意料不到的事发生了。

\- Something unexpected happened to the cousin.

堂妹一个健步从七层楼高的二楼阳台跳下；堂哥不知怎的就挣脱白烟的束缚，也跑至楼边，目睹双脚落地的堂妹，竟一点皮外伤没有。

\- The cousin took a step from the second-floor balcony seven stories high; somehow, the cousin broke free from the bondage of white smoke and also ran to the edge of the building, witnessing the cousin landing on both feet without any external injuries.

堂哥来至一楼。

\- The cousin came to the first floor.

堂妹无论说是什么都要堂哥一起陪着，可能是受了惊吓，可能是别的一些什么原因。堂妹嘴里，更是说一些暧昧，不清的话语。（故事的转折点）

\- No matter what the cousin said, she wanted her cousin to accompany her, maybe because she was frightened or for some other reason. The cousin’s mouth even said some ambiguous and unclear words. (The turning point of the story)

刚才一时的大风已经将一楼的大门吹开。

\- The strong wind just now had blown open the front door on the first floor.

堂哥上前关门，发现门外邻居平时不怎么住人的房屋，忽然有了人影、灯火。堂哥倍感不妙，赶紧锁了大门又锁。这时，堂妹又急忙赶来，说道是自己刚才也看见了一些不可名状、经历了一些无法言说的事情。

\- The cousin stepped forward to close the door and found that there were suddenly people and lights in the neighbor’s house that usually didn’t live in. The cousin felt bad and quickly locked the door again and again. At this time, the cousin hurried over again, saying that she had just seen some indescribable things and experienced some unspeakable things.

堂妹说是自己发现有白烟上了身，自己的灵魂突然不受控制，正当危机时刻，毅然决然跳下阳台，从而解决了白烟袭扰的事情。自己不知怎么，也变得强大起来。即便大门敞开，料外面一些不干净的东西，也不敢放肆大胆地进来。

\- The cousin said that she found that white smoke had gotten on her body, her soul suddenly became uncontrollable, and at a critical moment, she resolutely jumped off the balcony, thus solving the problem of white smoke harassment. She didn’t know how, but she also became stronger. Even if the door is open, it is expected that some unclean things outside will not dare to come in recklessly.

堂哥，仿似心里有鬼，还是决定关闭大门。就在堂哥转身的时候，门外起了敲门的声音。

\- The cousin, as if he had a ghost in his heart, still decided to close the door. Just as he turned around, there was a knock on the door outside.

关门当时，并未发现任何异常情况的堂兄，正如一开始发现白烟，会预感到一些不受控情况的发生；不过此刻堂兄的内心，也就是在敲门声响起的那一刻，彻底变得慌了起来！

\- At that time when he closed the door, the cousin who had not noticed any abnormal situation, just like when he first discovered white smoke, would have a premonition that some uncontrollable situations would happen; but at this moment his heart, that is, at that moment when there was a knock on the door outside, completely panicked!
