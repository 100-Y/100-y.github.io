爱国网友的不幸，也是不幸；美国记者的帮忙，也算帮忙。爱国网友可以没有脑子，美国记者同理。都可以反串，也都在互相嫌弃。谁不比谁高尚，谁和谁都一样丑陋。

\- The misfortune of patriotic netizens is also a misfortune; the help of American journalists is also a help. Patriotic netizens can be brainless, and so can American journalists. They can all be sarcastic, and they all despise each other. No one is more noble than anyone else, and everyone is equally ugly.
