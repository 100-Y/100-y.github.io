感性：“寇可往，吾亦可往。”——寇即是王，王亦是寇。

\- Emotional: “If Kou can go, I can also go.” – Kou is the king, and the king is also Kou.

折中：“寇成王败”——原始上下层的逻辑，应代替“成王败寇”——这一达尔文主义的社会性质，为之重新正名。——寇成了王，王落为寇。

\- Compromise: “Kou wins and King loses” – The original logic of the upper and lower layers should replace “King wins and Kou loses” – This Darwinian social nature, to rename it. – Kou became the king, and king fell to Kou.

理性：上位王，下为寇；成王败寇。上下皆为寇。

\- Rational: The upper position is King, and the lower position is Kou; King wins and Kou loses. Both upper and lower are Kou.

同理：人性，善恶之争。

你我都是“坏人”；✅你我都是好人。❌

你我都是坏人；❌你我都是“好人”。✅

\- Similarly: human nature, debate between good and evil.  
\- You and I are both “bad people”;✅ You and I are both good people.❌  
\- You and I are both bad people;❌You and I are both “good people”.✅
