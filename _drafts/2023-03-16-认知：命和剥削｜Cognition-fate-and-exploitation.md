剥削的本质，从来都是人吃人的认知。不把人当人。首先是自己拿自己不当人，比如：唯“命”（“上”和“下”，泛指，比如权力和命格），是从的“奴才”和“平民”；二个拿其ta人不当人，比如：被命压迫的奴才，转过头，便压迫认命和不认命的平民……

\- The essence of exploitation has always been the cognition of people eating people. Not treating people as human beings. First of all, is not treating oneself as a human being, for example: only “fate” (“up” and “down”, generally speaking, for example, power and fate) the “servant” and “commoner” followed; secondly, not treating others as human beings, for example: the servant who is oppressed by fate turns his head and oppresses the commoners, who accept fate and not accept…

把人踩在脚下的，永远都是相同且不同的认知。资本和权力不过相同且不同的人类，在认知上的各种反应。

\- Those who step on people are always the same and different cognitions. Capital and power are just the same and different human beings, with various reactions in cognition.

认知，即意识。命，也将为超前的认知所奴役，而遭受无穷无尽的剥削。

\- Cognition, that is, consciousness. Fate, will also be enslaved by advanced cognition, and suffer endless exploitation.
