2023/08/27# \*\*旅游｜Travel\*\*

被融化的冰川水，劈头盖脸的追逐。必死的局，却侥幸活了下来。

\- The melted glacier water, chasing me relentlessly. A desperate situation, but I was lucky to survive.

\# \*\*去好朋友家做客｜Visiting good friend’s home\*\*

好朋友家乱得一批。好朋友在家不穿衣服。和好朋友，在好朋友家的小区楼下，推心置腹，一直聊到深夜。好朋友家女友不怎么待见我。我被其言语，明里暗里赶出她家家门。

\- My good friend’s home was a mess. My good friend didn’t wear clothes at home. I and my good friend, downstairs in his community, confided in each other and talked until late at night. My good friend’s girlfriend didn’t like me very much. I was driven out of her home by her words, both openly and secretly.

我上楼取完行李，并嘱咐好友与他女友，其两人的生活才是每天的头等大事。并随时欢迎ta俩，有空到我家来玩。

\- I went upstairs to get my luggage, and told my friend and his girlfriend that their life was the most important thing every day. And I always welcome them to come to my home when they have time.

我打不到车，找不到酒店。我准备露宿网吧街头。

\- I couldn’t get a taxi, I couldn’t find a hotel. I was ready to sleep on the street outside the internet cafe.

尽管露宿网吧街头这事儿，已经做过很多次了。但每一次做，都是崭新的一次尝试。上一次，还是在去甘肃西和白雀寺经转的路上，汉中一条小街二层楼的网吧，借由凌晨煎饼的大妈指路。

\- Although sleeping on the street in Internet cafes has been done many times. But every time I do it, it is a brand new attempt. Last time, on the way to Xihe Gansu and Baique Temple, an Internet cafe on the second floor of a small street in Hanzhong, showed the way by the aunt of pancakes in the early morning.
