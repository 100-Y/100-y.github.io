学校发文——教师、学生照做——照做的学生与不照做的学生之间相互pk（斗争），赢的学生压倒输的学生——输的不听话的学生，接受学校教师的教育——教学校、教师双赢。

\- School Issued a document — Teachers and Students follow to do — A pk (fight) between Students who do and Students who don’t, and Students who win overwhelm Students who lose — Disobedient Students who lose, receive education from School’ Teachers — A win-win situation for School and Teachers.

期间，学校教师，出现重大教育失当问题——输的学生和赢的学生再次pk，重新赢的学生压倒重新输的学生，学校被迫勒令教师暂停教学的工作……——输的不听话的学生，再继续接受其它学校教师的教育——学校双赢。

\- During this period, School’ Teachers experience major educational malpractice problems — The Students who lost and the Students who won pk again, the Students who win NEW overwhelm the Students who lose NEW, School forced to order Teachers to suspend teaching work… — The disobedient Students who lose, continue to receive the “education” from other School’ Teachers — A win-win situation for Schools.

学校：自始至终，我都是在为学员服务，都在努力尽教育的职责。出现问题，我也及时处罚教师了。你们还想要我怎样？

教师：我听学校的话。

赢的学生：沾沾自喜。

输的学生：下回我要赢回来！

\- School: From the beginning to the end, I have been serving for the Students and trying best to fulfill the responsibility of education. If there is a problem, I also punish the Teachers in time. What else do you want me to do?  
\- Teachers: I listen to the School.  
\- Winning Students: Complacent.  
\- Losing Students: I’ll win back next time!

如此来回，大家都仿佛没有输赢。可真的是这样么？？

\- So back and forth, everyone seems to have not won or lost. Is it really so? ?
