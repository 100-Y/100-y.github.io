某个人、某个阶段，开始变得唯唯诺诺，不太敢自由发表，或是拥有个人独特的见解。这时，大概率这人的潜意识，正在同当时所处的环境如何地进行抗争，比如：选择是否要被其同化、控制和吞噬，还是隐藏、躺平与反击。

\- A certain person, at a certain stage, began to become submissive, don’t dare to express freely or have personal unique opinions. At this time, there is a high probability that this person’s subconsciousness, is fighting against the environment in that time, for example: Choose whether to be assimilated, controlled and swallowed by it, or hide, lie down and fight back.

唯命是从、取决于我，两种截然不同的处理方式，也造就二者各自不同的人生。

\- Be obedient or up to me, the two completely different handling methods, have also created two own different lives.
