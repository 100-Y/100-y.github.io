原子弹光束一样的爆炸之下，会诞生一个真正的食人魔鬼。

\- Under the explosion of an atomic bomb beam, a real man-eating demon will be born.

\# \*\*大爆炸前后｜Before and after the big bang\*\*

片刻前的“预知”：强烈的光速，会让人睁不开眼睛。只能捂住双眼躲进墙的角落，寻找还可以不断遮挡的地方。

\- A moment ago’s “foreknowledge”: Strong light speed will make people unable to open their eyes. They can only cover their eyes and hide in the corner of the wall, looking for a place that can still be blocked.

片刻后的“现实”：怀里抱着极尽想要守护的新的生命，只是食人魔鬼献祭给自己旧的诞生。

\- A moment later’s “reality”: Holding a new life that you want to protect in your arms, it is just a sacrifice to the old birth of a man-eating demon.

\# \*\*儿子、女儿｜Son, daughter\*\*

当自己的“一个女儿”，变异成为魔鬼的“十个儿子”。

\- When one’s “daughter” mutates into a demon’s “ten sons”.

被魔鬼选定之人，有其拦不住的宿命和归途；身上刻画着十个生命的印记。潜意识主动上交，则是保全自己，避免成为无端牺牲品最行之有效的方式。

\- The person chosen by the demon has an unstoppable fate and destination; with ten life marks engraved on his body. Consciously surrendering is the most effective way to preserve oneself and avoid becoming an innocent victim.

\# \*\*插翅难飞｜Hard to fly with wings\*\*

躲过大爆炸，躲过强烈的辐射，却躲不过注定的悲剧。

\- Escape the big bang, escape the strong radiation, but can’t escape the destined tragedy.

夜晚，乡下漆黑的楼顶，一场核爆波及过后，出现三层楼高的一个食人鬼，寻着快要死亡的气息，四目相对、闪移，过后夺走怀里竭尽守护的旧的生命。为了考验脆弱无比的人性，开展了一场：人类要不要献祭挚爱同胞遗体，求得魔鬼吃掉，从而换取生存的一个悲情故事。

\- At night, on the dark roof of the countryside, after a nuclear explosion wave, a three-story tall man-eating ghost appeared, looking for the breath of death, four eyes facing each other, flashing and moving, and then took away the old life that was exhausted in his arms. In order to test the fragile human nature, a sad story was launched: whether humans should sacrifice their loved ones’ remains and ask the demon to eat them in exchange for survival.

\# \*\*人性的考验｜Test of human nature\*\*

食人魔鬼吃掉变异逝去生命的做法，逝去的生命还有无活着时候必要存在的意义，以及自己不太能经受住考验的人心：一时间赶在魔鬼夺走旧的新生命之前，犹豫要不要主动抛弃。

\- The practice of man-eating demons eating mutated deceased lives, whether the deceased life still has the necessary meaning when it is alive, and its own heart that cannot withstand the test: for a while before the demon takes away the old new life , Hesitated whether to take the initiative to abandon.

\# \*\*归纳、总结｜Summary\*\*

这是我做过的所有梦中，最惊悚最让人害怕的一个。这样纠结的人性考验，瞬间使得自己清醒，这才凌晨4点40。

\- This is the most thrilling and scary dream I have ever had. Such a tangled test of human nature instantly made me sober up. It was only 4:40 in the morning.
