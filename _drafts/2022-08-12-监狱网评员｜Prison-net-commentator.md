不是说，监狱人员就不得有改过自新的机会；而是讲，把原本有偿的工作，转嫁给，没有反抗能力的免费劳动力。这本身就是一种赚取额外利益的剥削。

\- It is not to say that prisoners should not have the opportunity to reform; rather, it is to transfer the originally paid work to free labor without the ability to resist. This in itself is a kind of exploitation for earning extra benefits.

看似监狱系统、服刑人员、制定政策的领导，多方都一个获利。实则，最大的受损方还是，舆论、网络环境，以及ta们内部负责兜底的自己人。

\- The prison system, prisoners, and leaders who formulate policies seem to all profit. In fact, the biggest losers are still public opinion, the Internet environment, and their own people who are responsible for covering up internally.
