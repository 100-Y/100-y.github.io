共沉沦，大概是一些中国人，面对困境，安慰自己，最能隐忍的品质。——“又不是只我一人，这样”：这样一种豁达的观念，疫情之下……体现得淋漓尽致。

\- Sinking together, perhaps it is the most enduring quality of some Chinese people, who comfort themselves in the face of difficulties. – “It’s not just me, like this”: such a broad-minded idea, under the epidemic… it is vividly demonstrated.

从“苟富贵、勿相忘”，趋炎附势到有了一点权力，足够多的拥趸乃至一人之下、权倾朝野……又是ta们，寻求改变而刻在骨子里的精髓。共沉沦，可以；个别人独善其身，就是不行。想方设法，都要达到甚至进行超越。贬低自身、变相抬高别人的事情，ta们一直在做。

\- From “If we are rich and honored, do not forget each other”, to following the trend and gaining some power, enough followers and even being second to none, with power over the whole court… it is them again, who seek change and engrave it in their bones. Sinking together, that’s fine; but individual people who save themselves, that’s not acceptable. They try every means to achieve or even surpass. They have been doing things that belittle themselves and indirectly elevate others.

本可以同富裕，再努努力就行，可ta们宁死，都不愿选择相信。毕竟共沉沦要付出的代价，就摆在现实眼前；相比虚幻的未来，要少太多太多了！

\- They could have been rich together, just work harder, but they would rather die than choose to believe. After all, the price of sinking together is right in front of reality; compared to the illusory future, it is too much less!
