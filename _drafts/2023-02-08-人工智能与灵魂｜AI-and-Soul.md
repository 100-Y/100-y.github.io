人工智能，会替代人类么？答案首先是，不会。

\- Will Artificial Intelligence replace human? The answer is, first of all, NO.

人工智能（AI），是人类程序、指令，设定正确的产物；一些人类错误的行为方式，不在计算之内。而往往，正确和错误，是相对的，犹如理性和感性的分别。这也是AI，彻底替代不了人类的根本原因。

\- Artificial intelligence (AI), is the product of human Programs, instructions, set Right; some human Wrong Way of behavior, is not included in the calculation. And often, right and wrong, is relative, as if the rational and emotional respectively. This is also the fundamental reason why AI, completely unable to replace human beings.

通俗的讲法，AI没有属于它自己的灵魂。同理反推，没有自己灵魂的人类，恰与AI无异。这又是何等残酷的一个现实！

\- In layman’s term, AI has no Soul of its own. By the same token, human beings without Their own souls are no different from AI. This is also a cruel reality!
