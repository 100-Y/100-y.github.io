2023/12/04成都冬天的雾霾要人命，二十年如一日的那种。就像头顶牵满了波斯（蜘蛛）网，网上尽是巨大的颗粒与尘埃。人站在网下，用扫把捣鼓，巨大的颗粒与尘埃落得整个屋子到处都是。扫都扫不干净。

\- The haze in winter in Chengdu is life-threatening, twenty years is a day. Just like the head is covered with Persian (spider) web, the web is full of huge particles and dust. People stood under the net, messing with brooms, and huge particles and dust fell all over the house. You can’t even sweep clean.

唯有戴口罩，加开空气净化器，吸尘器……以免落得一身的呼吸道疾病及其引发的癌症。

\- Only wearing a mask, adding air purifier, vacuum cleaner… To avoid respiratory disease and cancer of the whole body caused by it.
