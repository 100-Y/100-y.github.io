现实的世界我是一个哑巴，  
于是偶尔会与心里的那个它谈话。  
我说：“为什么有的人生来没有嘴？”  
它沉思的眼睛尝试作答，好像一切是真的。  
于是大海蒸发，江河流成了沼泽，  
雨水倒灌，沙漠长出了湖泊。  
“如是这样，没有东西将一成不变！？”  
是的，我亦陷入了沉思：  
鱼儿为了生存，爬行成人类；  
到头来，人类却要吃它……  
身为哑巴，深知现实世界里没有说话的权利，  
我谨遵这条“教导”，  
待身处梦境，张口说话之时，  
我就回答你这个问题。

- In the real world, I am a mute,
- So I occasionally talk to it in my heart.
- I said, “Why are some people born without a mouth?”
- Its thoughtful eyes tried to answer, as if everything was true.
- So the sea evaporated, and the river became a swamp,
- Rainwater poured in, and the desert grew lakes.
- “Is it true that nothing will remain unchanged!?”
- Yes, I too fell into contemplation:
- Fish crawl into humans for survival;
- In the end, humans have to eat them…
- As a mute, I know deep down that there is no right to speak in the real world,
- I follow this “teaching” carefully,
- When I am in a dream and open my mouth to speak,
- I will answer your this question.
