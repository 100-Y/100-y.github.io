“假如一间铁屋子，是绝无窗户而万难破毁的，里面有许多熟睡的人们，不久都要闷死了，然而是从昏睡入死灭，并不感到就死的悲哀。现在你大嚷起来，惊起了较为清醒的几个人，使这不幸的少数者来受无可挽救的临终的苦楚，你倒以为对得起他们么?”

\- “If there is an iron house, with no windows and impossible to destroy, and inside there are many sleeping people who will soon suffocate to death, but they will die from sleep to death without feeling the sadness of death. Now if you shout loudly and wake up a few more sober people, causing these unfortunate few to suffer the incurable pain of dying, do you think you are doing them a favor?”

“然而几个人既然起来，你不能说决没有毁坏这铁屋的希望。”

\- “However, since a few people have woken up, you cannot say that there is no hope of destroying this iron house.”

——鲁迅｜Lu Xun
