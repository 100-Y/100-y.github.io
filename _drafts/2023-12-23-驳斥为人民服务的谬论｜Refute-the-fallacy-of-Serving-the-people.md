2023/12/23“人民”幸福，在于“党”的领导；党的“幸福”，在于“被领导”的人民。（这不高级黑么）人民领导，为人民服务；党领导，为党。

\- The happiness of “People” lies in the leadership of “Party”, and the “happiness” of party lies in the “led” people. (Isn’t this high-level blacken?) The leadership of People, serves the people; the leadership of Party, serves the party.
