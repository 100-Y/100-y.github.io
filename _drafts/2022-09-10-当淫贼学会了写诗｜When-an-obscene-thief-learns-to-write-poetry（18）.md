用以展示和揭露自己内心，“丑陋不堪”的一面。同时，区分和讽刺，那些欲遮还羞、只敢搞擦边球的“屎尿屁诗”。

\- It is used to show and expose the “ugly” side of my own heart. At the same time, it distinguishes and satirises those “shit poems” that only dare to make a fool of themselves.

宝：

想掏出大肉棒从后面顶你  
隔着内裤脱掉内裤都顶你  
一只手弄湿你前面的小穴  
另一只随处探寻轻抚揉捏  
一会儿停留在你的腰间、一会儿你的乳房……  
用鼻子、嘴巴、舌头“顶你”  
你的脖子，你的耳朵，嘴巴、舌头……  
听你急不可耐的娇喘声  
十指紧扣抱着你的同时  
将大肉棒慢送进你身体  
前后左右来回摩擦搅动  
累了、歇息一下，翻过身  
照“前面的流程”，与你再做几次  
你将唇印布满我的每一寸肌肤  
我则疯狂吮吸继续带给你快感  
当你娇喘的声音越发让人销魂  
我也强忍不住一次次勃起射精  
日日彼此流出的黏液  
夜夜交织都擦不太干

\- Baby:

\- I want to take out my big cock and fuck you from behind  
\- Push you even through your panties and take them off  
\- One hand to wet your front pussy  
\- And the other hand to explore and caress and knead  
\- One hand on your waist, the other on your breasts…  
\- “Pushing” you with my nose, my mouth, my tongue  
\- Your neck, your ears, your mouth, your tongue…

\- Listening to your impatient gasps  
\- Holding you tightly with all your fingers  
\- Slowly pushing my cock into you  
\- Rubbing and stirring the pussy back and forth, left and right, repeatedly

\- When tired, take a break and turn over  
\- We’ll do it the same way we did before

\- You cover every inch of my skin with your lips  
\- I’ll continue to suck and bring you pleasure  
\- As your gasps become more and more pleasurable  
\- I can’t help myself, erections and ejaculations over and over again

\- The slime that comes out of each other’s body day after day  
\- Night after night can’t dry them off
