城市是一部静默运作的制度机器，而公共设施，则是它向‘身体’伸出的手指。它们不说话，却决定谁能停留，谁需等待；谁被照护，谁需隐匿。那一道道被打开的门，不是为了进入，而是为了筛选与分层。空间，是规范的皮肤，也是自由的幻觉。

The city is a silently operating machine of systems, and public facilities—they are the fingers it extends toward the body. They do not speak, yet they decide who may linger, who must wait; who is cared for, who must remain unseen. Each door that opens is not an invitation to enter, but a mechanism of sorting, of stratification. Space is the skin of regulation, and the illusion of freedom.
