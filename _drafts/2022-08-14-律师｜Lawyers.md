律师，不代表正义，也并不为人民服务。律师，只是有些人，拿来吃饭的工具。律师怕事，律师也睁一只眼，闭另外一只。ta们，良心的太少，不干正事的很多。  
  
\- Lawyers do not represent justice, nor do they serve the people. Lawyers are just tools for some people to make a living. Lawyers are afraid of trouble, and they also turn a blind eye. There are too few of them with a conscience, and many of them do not do the right thing.
