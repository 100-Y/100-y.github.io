重农抑商（封建）、重商（民国）到全都收归国有（新中国公有制），再到允许私营企业（私有制）。计划经济转型到市场经济。意识发生转向，不再搞斗私、批修的老一套。完全是：吸收外部苏联的教训与美国等的帮助，和凭仗内部广大年轻的无产阶级劳动人民的艰苦奋斗（穷怕了）。

\- From stress agriculture and suppress commerce (feudalism), to stress commerce (Republic of China), to nationalization of all assets (public ownership in New China), to allowing private enterprises (private ownership). Transition from planned economy to market economy. Change of consciousness, no longer engaging in the old practices of fighting against private interests and criticizing revisionism. It is entirely: absorbing the lessons from the Soviet Union and the help from the United States and others, and relying on the hard work of the vast young proletariat (afraid of poverty).
