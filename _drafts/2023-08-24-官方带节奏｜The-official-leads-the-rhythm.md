2023/08/24问：官方带节奏，是带节奏么？

答：“官方带节奏，是为了您好！”

\- Question: Is it a rhythm to lead the rhythm by the official?  
\- Answer: “The official leads the rhythm, for your sake!”

“一句为了您好”，就可以掌夺和破坏“您”之外的任何物品。“为了集体”，就可以随意剥削一些个人的基本权益。一部分家长如是，负责家长制的官员，更甚。

\- “With a word for your sake”, can seize and destroy anything outside of “you”. “For the collective”, can arbitrarily exploit some basic rights of individuals. Some parents are like this, and the officials in charge of parental system are even worse.
