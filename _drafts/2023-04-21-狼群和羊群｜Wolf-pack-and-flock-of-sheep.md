从前，有一群狼，他们经常饿肚子，因为他们不会打猎，只会偷吃别人的食物。他们看到山坡上有一群肥美的羊，就想出了一个计划。

\- Once upon a time, there was a pack of wolves who were often hungry because they didn’t know how to hunt and only stole food from others. They saw a flock of fat sheep on the hillside and came up with a plan.

他们披上了羊皮，混入了羊群中，假装自己是羊的朋友。他们还对羊说：“我们是来自远方的伟大的使者，我们知道很多天文地理，我们可以教你们很多有用的东西。你们只要听从我们的指挥，就可以过上幸福安康的生活。”

\- They put on sheepskins and blended in with the flock, pretending to be friends of the sheep. They even said to the sheep: “We are great messengers from afar. We know a lot about astronomy and geography and can teach you many useful things. As long as you follow our commands, you can live a happy and healthy life.”

羊们听了，都很信服，觉得这些陌生的羊很有学问，很有威望，就愿意跟着他们走。狼们趁机带着羊们走到一个偏僻的地方，然后一个个地把他们吃掉。

\- The sheep listened and were convinced that these strange sheep were knowledgeable and prestigious, so they were willing to follow them. The wolves took the opportunity to lead the sheep to a remote place and then ate them one by one.

就这样，狼们每天都吃得饱饱的，而羊们却越来越少。有一天，只剩下了一只小羊。它发现了狼们的真面目，就对他们说：“你们真是太坏了，你们披着‘良善’的皮，做一些‘真恶’的事。你们不是伟大的使者，而是虚假的骗子。你们欺骗了我们所有的同伴，让他们失去了生命。”

\- In this way, the wolves ate their fill every day while the number of sheep dwindled. One day, only one lamb was left. It discovered the true nature of the wolves and said to them: “You are so bad. You wear the skin of ‘goodness’ and do ‘truly evil’ things. You are not great messengers but false deceivers. You have deceived all our companions and caused them to lose their lives.”

狼们听了，都哈哈大笑，说：“小傻瓜，你以为我们在乎你们的生命吗？我们只在乎我们自己的肚子。你现在知道真相又有什么用呢？反正你也要死了。”说完，他们就把小羊也吃掉了。

\- The wolves listened and laughed out loud, saying: “Little fool, do you think we care about your lives? We only care about our own stomachs. What’s the use of knowing the truth now? You’re going to die anyway.” With that, they ate the little lamb too.

这则寓言故事反映了当今社会一些问题的症结，比如：

\- This fable reflects some of the problems in today’s society, such as:

有些人为了私利而欺骗、利用、伤害别人。有些人缺乏判断力和警惕性，轻信别人的花言巧语。有些人不努力学习和进步，而依赖别人的指导和安排。有些人不团结和互助，而任由自己和同伴受到危害。

\- Some people deceive, exploit, and harm others for their own gain. Some people lack judgment and vigilance and easily believe in others’ sweet talk. Some people do not strive to learn and improve but rely on others’ guidance and arrangements. Some people are not united and helpful but allow themselves and their companions to be endangered.
