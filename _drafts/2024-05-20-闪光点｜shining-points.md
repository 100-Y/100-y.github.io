2024/05/20不必怀疑自身闪光的点，无人探寻就尝试埋没了它；相反正是因为过于耀眼、不易挖掘，才会迟迟开采不到想要的果实。

\- There's no need to doubt the shining points within oneself, for if left unexplored, attempts to bury them may arise; on the contrary, it is precisely because they are too dazzling and not easily unearthed, that the desired fruits remain unharvested for so long.
