黑夜的雨天，仅有些许微光。赤脚。分别尝试走动、快速奔跑、滑行，在乡间的碎玻璃、石子、铺了一层水泥的平整道路。道路上，众多穿鞋人士，以“赛跑”的名义，争先恐后地出发。都有停停走走、哭天喊地、滑板来回穿行的……一开始便需下定狠心的咬牙坚持、能够适应了的正常环境，过渡到得心应手。最后起身的跳跃，停留在家的门口。

A rainy night, with only a faint glimmer of light. Barefoot. Trying to walk, run quickly, and glide across the countryside, stepping on broken glass, pebbles, and a cemented road. On the road, many people wearing shoes, under the guise of a "race," rush forward. Stopping, crying out, and skating back and forth… From the start, it requires a firm determination to push through, adapting to the familiar environment, transitioning into something fluid and effortless. In the end, a leap that lands at the doorstep of home.
