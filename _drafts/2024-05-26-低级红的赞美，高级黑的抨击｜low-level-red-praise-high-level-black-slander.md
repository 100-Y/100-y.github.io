2024/05/26所谓的“低级红”，指的是那些过于简单化、庸俗化的支持表达，而“高级黑”则是指那些表面上看似赞美，实际上却含有讽刺和批评的言论。这些术语通常用来描述在舆论场上的某些现象，其中“低级红”可能因为过于夸张或者不贴合实际而被人利用，进而转变成“高级黑”，即那些看似赞美实则贬损的言论。因此，从某种角度来看，“低级红”的赞美确实可能会被视为对“高级黑”的一种无意识的抨击，因为它可能无意中提供了“高级黑”攻击的抓手。

\- The so-called "low-level red" refers to those expressions of support that are too simplistic and vulgar, while "high-level black" refers to those words that seem to be praise on the surface but actually contain sarcasm and criticism. These terms are often used to describe certain phenomena in the public sphere. "Low-level red" may be used by others because it is too exaggerated or unrealistic, and thus turned into "high-level black", that is, words that seem to be praise but are actually derogatory. Therefore, from a certain point of view, "low-level red" praise can indeed be regarded as an unconscious attack on "high-level black", because it may inadvertently provide a handle for "high-level black" attacks.
