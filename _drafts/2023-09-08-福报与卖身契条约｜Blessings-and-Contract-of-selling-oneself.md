2023/09/08强制听从“上级”的安排与召唤，是“五斗米”们必要付出的代价之一。“吃人嘴软、拿人手短”，这一社会通用的卖身契条约，在“机构和组织”层面，也体现得淋漓尽致；更是作为“福报”有关的最佳论据之一。

\- Forced obedience to the arrangements and summons of the “superiors” is one of the necessary prices that the “Five-dous of rice” have to pay. “Eating from someone’s mouth makes one soft, taking someone’s hand makes one short”, this universally applicable contract of selling oneself is also vividly reflected at the “institution and organization” level; it is even more one of the best arguments related to “blessings”.

可“机构和组织”清醒着勒，吸星大法、乾坤大挪移、暗渡陈仓、赏罚分明……无中生有的把戏，玩的出神入化。

\- But the “institutions and organizations” are sober, and they play tricks such as star-absorbing magic, heaven-and-earth shifting, secret crossing of Chen Cang, clear rewards and punishments… They create something out of nothing and play it superbly.

福报：是指人在世间所做的善事或功德，能够带来吉祥和幸福的因果报应。福报不仅影响个人的命运，还可以转移给亲友或后代。然而，在现代社会中，福报的概念往往被某些“机构和组织”利用，来绑架或诱惑信徒。他们要求信徒无条件地服从他们的安排和召唤。

\- Blessings: It refers to the good deeds or merits that people do in the world, which can bring auspiciousness and happiness to the causal retribution. Blessings not only affect one’s own destiny, but can also be transferred to relatives or descendants. However, in modern society, the concept of blessings is often used by some “institutions and organizations” to kidnap or lure believers. They require believers to unconditionally obey their arrangements and summons.

这样的做法实际上是一种卖身契约。信徒为了得到所谓的福报，不惜出卖自己的财产、自由、尊严甚至灵魂。他们失去了自己的判断力和批判思维，变成了“机构和组织”的奴隶和工具。

\- This kind of practice is actually a contract of selling oneself. In order to obtain the so-called blessings, believers do not hesitate to sell their property, freedom, dignity and even soul. They lose their judgment and critical thinking, and become slaves and tools of the “institutions and organizations”.

他们不知道，真正的福报是来源于自己的内心和行为，而不是外在的因素和物质。他们也不知道，真正的善法是能够让人解脱苦难和迷惑，而不是增加束缚和烦恼。

\- They do not know that the real blessings come from their own hearts and actions, not from external factors and materials. They also do not know that the real good law can liberate people from suffering and confusion, not increase bondage and trouble.

因此，我们应该警惕那些打着福报旗号的“机构和组织”，不要轻信他们的花言巧语和虚假承诺。我们应该保持清醒和理智，用自己的智慧和良知来判断是非善恶。我们应该坚持自己的原则和底线，不要为了一时的利益而出卖自己的价值和信念。我们应该积极地做一个有道德、有责任、有担当的人，用自己的善行来造福自己和社会。这才是真正的积累福报和修行善法。

\- Therefore, we should be vigilant of those “institutions and organizations” that use the banner of blessings, and do not believe their sweet words and false promises. We should keep sober and rational, and use our own wisdom and conscience to judge right and wrong, good and evil. We should stick to our own principles and bottom lines, and do not sell our own values and beliefs for temporary benefits. We should actively be a person with morality, responsibility, and accountability, and use our own good deeds to benefit ourselves and society. This is the real accumulation of blessings and cultivation of good law.
