很难形容的一场梦。熟悉的剧情，不俗套的进程。

\- It’s a dream that’s hard to describe. A familiar plot, but not a clichéd process.

小时，破败的房屋。看到谁谁谁的棺材坟墓，经年累月，又被谁谁谁新鲜的覆盖……有一家人，就住在这片具有悠久历史的乡土之上。在一个晚上。又听起年长的人，讲同样的一个鬼故事：\*\*有“人”，在梦里\*\*，因为你……

\- When young, the house was in ruins. Saw someone’s coffin and grave, which was covered by someone else’s fresh grave over the years… There was a family living on this land with a long history. One night, heard the elders telling the same ghost story again: there is a “person” in the dream, because of you…

（外面，此刻街上\*\*“不知哪来了一个盆子”，在响\*\*。我不敢探出头去看，我的内心在发凉。想继续写，却感觉\*\*窗外有什么东西看着窗内\*\*。我的内心连着后背……我看了看窗外，我鼓起勇气。更是下定决心，一探大街究竟。我调亮灯光，穿齐裤儿、关掉风扇，显得大热天里，不用打冷战。补：）

\- (Outside, at this moment, there is a “basin from nowhere” ringing on the street. I dare not stick my head out to see, my heart is chilling. I want to continue writing, but I feel like there is something outside the window looking in. My heart and back… I looked outside the window, I mustered up my courage. I was even more determined to explore the street. I turned up the light, put on my pants, turned off the fan, and it seemed that it was hot and there was no need to fight the cold. Supplement:)

……说梦话，因为你正在做的梦。它们成了你。你的话语和梦，创造了它们。

\- …talking, because of the dream you are having. They become you. Your words and dreams create them.

我不信，我一步步落入，安排好的这个梦境。

\- I don’t believe it, I step by step into this arranged dream.

（我补齐了这个梦。我感到呼吸出现问题，我打开风扇，空调也开启除湿的模式……“呓鬼”，它并没有\*\*从梦里\*\*，跟随我到现实。有那么一刻，我希望呓鬼们真实存在。“狗厂”，就不敢再肆意，排放有毒气体和制作噪音。）

\- (I completed this dream. I felt breathing problems, I turned on the fan, and the air conditioner also turned on the dehumidification mode… “Yi ghosts”, it didn’t follow me from the dream to reality. There was a moment when I wished Yi ghosts really existed. “Damn factory”, will no longer dare to emit toxic gases and make noise recklessly.)

\*\*听话方生、闻心而动……\*\*地板发出稀碎的声音，真像“呓鬼们”走路时候的样子。

\- Hearing Word to Born, Smelling Soul to Move… The floor made a sparse sound, just like the way “Yi ghosts” walk.
