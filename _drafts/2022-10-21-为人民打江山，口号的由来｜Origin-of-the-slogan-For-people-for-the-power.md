江山的“恶”，不许ta人提起、自己也从不主动改正。愈多的人民，选择“攻讦”。江山、不满……人民、不悦。于是这样，便有了：打江山、因为人民；为了人民、打江山。

\- The “evil” of power is not allowed to be mentioned by others, and it never takes initiative to correct self. More and more people choose to “attack”. The power, dissatisfied…the people, unhappy. Thus, there is: Beating for the power, because of people; for the people, beating the power.
