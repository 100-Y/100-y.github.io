何为高级黑？举例：像环球这种自家媒体，选择爆料与否。好心办坏事，不知不觉间的一个对比，却起到反讽效果。低级红的意思，就更好理解了。无脑吹自己的同时，也可以干些全力贬损ta人的活路。

\- What is high-level blacken? For example, the own media like Globe Times, chooses whether to break the story or not. The unwittingly contrast on good intentions but do bad things, has an ironic effect. The meaning of low-level redden is better understood. Mindlessly blowing oneself up at the same time, can also do some works fully derogatory to others.

而低级黑，不过低级红无脑吹的变种，是相同一个意思。又举例美媒，在辱美这件事上，有着广大的群众基础。一看，似乎只是辱美；二看，好像又不仅仅是。何为高级红，大概这便是了！

\- And low-level blacken, is just a variation of the low-level redden on mindless blowing, which means the same thing. Another example is the American media, which has a wide public base when it comes to insulting the United States. At first glance, it seems to be just insulting the United States; at second glance, it seems to be more than that. What is high-level redden? Probably this it is!
