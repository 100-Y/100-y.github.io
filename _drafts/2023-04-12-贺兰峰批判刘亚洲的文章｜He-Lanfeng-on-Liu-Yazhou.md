宣传口说他是“双面人”……

\- The propaganda mouth says he is a “double-faced man”…

于收藏爱好者，早就收藏了他的一些文字作品。继承“政治体制改革的遗志”，于右派而言，通篇都是对刘的一个正名。

\- For collectors, some of his written works have long been collected. Inheriting the “legacy of political system reform,” from the perspective of the rightists, the whole article is a vindication of Liu.

这样的一篇文章，写的“蠢得不能再蠢”了！更加从反向角度，凸显和让人充满疑问：“应该要走的正道”，究竟是怎样的一条正道？看似对“回到正轨”，起一个推波助澜的作用，实则让旁人更清楚和了解到“正轨”，原来真正的面目。

\- Such an article is written “so stupid that it can’t be any more stupid”! It even highlights and raises doubts from the opposite perspective: what exactly is the “right path” that should be taken? It seems to play a role in promoting and boosting the “return to the right track”, but in fact it makes others more clearly understand and understand that the “right track” is actually its true face.

这样的一篇文章，何尝又不是另一种形式的“高级黑”。

\- Such an article is also another form of “high-level blacken”.
