近日，秦国一农民，身体老是抱恙，无法按时完成，年度的粮食缴纳额度。暗地里的某天，农民发现，一走私盐的商贩。将商贩举报到衙门，于是衙门充公了商贩的所有器具和收益。并答应农民，下一年再征收欠下的粮款。\*\*农民感激涕零\*\*。  
  
\- Recently, a farmer in the Qin State was always sick and could not complete the annual grain payment quota on time. One day in secret, the farmer discovered a smuggled salt dealer. The dealer was reported to the Yamen, so the Yamen confiscated all the dealer’s tools and income. And promised the farmer to collect the owed grain payment next year. The farmer was grateful.  
  
近日，\*\*还是\*\*秦国一农民，身体老是抱恙，无法按时量完成，年度的粮食“缴纳额度”。暗地里的某天，农民发现，一走私盐的商贩。  
  
\- Recently, it was still a farmer in Qin State, who was always sick and could not complete the annual grain “payment quota” on time. One day in secret, the farmer discovered a smuggled salt dealer.  
  
\*\*农民威胁商贩，将其举报到衙门，衙门好充公商贩所有的器具和收益。\*\*商贩吓傻了，给农民开出条件，愿意拿出部分贩盐的收益，帮助农民解决征粮的问题。农民暗戳戳地答应，\*\*商贩感激涕零\*\*。  
  
\- The farmer threatened the dealer and reported it to the Yamen. The Yamen was good at confiscating all the dealer’s tools and income. The dealer was frightened and offered conditions to the farmer, willing to take out part of the salt trafficking income to help the farmer solve the problem of levying grain. The farmer secretly agreed, and the dealer was grateful.  
  
近日，\*\*也还是\*\*秦国一农民，身体老是抱恙，无法按时完成，年度的粮食“缴纳额度”。暗地里的某天，农民发现，一走私盐的商贩。（\*\*不同的是，这回农民他忍受不下高压的纳粮政策了。\*\*）  
  
\- Recently, it was still a farmer in Qin State who was always sick and could not complete the annual grain “payment quota” on time. One day in secret, the farmer discovered a smuggled salt dealer. (The difference is that this time the farmer can no longer bear the high-pressure grain collection policy.)  
  
农民威胁商贩，将其举报到衙门，衙门好充公商贩所有的器具和收益。商贩吓傻了，被迫答应加入农民反抗的队伍。后来，谋反的事情败露。\*\*农民和商贩双双被抓住，斩首……\*\*  
  
\- The farmer threatened the dealer and reported it to the Yamen. The Yamen was good at confiscating all of the dealer’s tools and income. The dealer was frightened and forced to join the ranks of farmers’ resistance. Later, when the rebellion failed, both farmers and dealers were caught and beheaded…  
  
再后来，\*\*陈胜、吴广……纷纷站起来反抗\*\*，并最终成功推翻了暴秦的统治。  
  
\- Later, Chen Sheng, Wu Guang… stood up one after another to resist, and finally successfully overthrew Qin’s rule.
