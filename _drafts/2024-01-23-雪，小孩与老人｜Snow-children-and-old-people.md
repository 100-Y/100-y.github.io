2024/01/23雪，在小孩与老人的眼里，可能完全是两种截然不同的观感。丰年，伴随大批的死亡。雪，只是雪，小孩与老人，一个是小孩，一个则是老人。

\- Snow, in the eyes of children and old people, may be completely two different feelings. A bumper year, accompanied by a large number of deaths. Snow is just snow, children and old people, one is a child, one is an old person.
