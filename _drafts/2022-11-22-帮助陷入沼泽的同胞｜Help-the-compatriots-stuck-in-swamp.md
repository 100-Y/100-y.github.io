很多人，都忘本了。包括以前的自己，忘了最初一开始，应该成为怎样的一个人。一个能同情ta人遭遇，可以伸出援助之手，而不是“事不关己高高挂起”，抛弃一部分良知，也要努力奋进向上爬的冷漠之徒。

\- Many people have forgotten their roots. Including the former self, forgot what kind of person I should be at the beginning. A person who can sympathize with other people’s suffering, can extend a helping hand, but an indifferent person who “has nothing to do with ownself and hangs high”, abandons part of conscience and strives to climb up.

多伸手拉拉陷入沼泽的同胞，不要无视，甚至借机踩过ta们的头顶，方便自己快速地通过。不希望，到头自己也遇到那么一天的时候，才明白：

\- Reach out more and pull up the compatriots stuck in swamp, don’t ignore them, but even take the opportunity to step on their heads so can pass quickly. Don’t hope in the end, when also meet such a day, just understand that:

沼泽地没有尽头，自己也仅仅只是，提供来为ta人垫脚的石头。需要大家齐心协力，沼泽地才能成功走出。

\- There is no end to the swamp, ownself but also a stone provided for the other people to step on. It needs everyone working together to get out of the swamp successfully.
