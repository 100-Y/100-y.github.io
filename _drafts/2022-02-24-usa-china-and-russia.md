在美方看来，苏联和中方是对全球最大的威胁。相反，在苏联和中方看来，美方是。

中方为什么不指责苏联？因为是绑在一条绳上的蚂蚱。苏联曾帮助中方，夺了中华民国在大陆的政权。同理：中华民国为什么不指责美方？因为，在美方的支持下，其战胜了日本，最穷困潦倒的时候，也帮助守住了台湾。

都说只有永恒的利益，没有一直的敌人。中方可以分别同苏联/美方携起手来对抗美方/苏联。苏联也很清楚地知道，它有一个反复横跳的小弟。

当小弟变大哥。曾经的大哥们，会不会再次携起手来。这是一个值得深思的问题。和平、对话，是主旋律；战争撕裂人心，人心永远不可能大同。

In the eyes of the US, the Soviet Union and China are the biggest threats to the world. Conversely, in the eyes of the Soviet Union and China, the US is.

Why doesn’t China criticize the Soviet Union? Because they are grasshoppers tied to the same rope. The Soviet Union once helped China, taking over the power of the Republic of China on the mainland. Similarly: Why doesn’t the Republic of China criticize the US? Because, with the support of the US, it defeated Japan, and in the most impoverished and down-and-out time, it also helped to hold Taiwan.

They say there are only eternal interests, no constant enemies. China can join hands with the Soviet Union/US to fight against the US/Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also knows very well that it has a little brother who is constantly jumping around.

When the little brother becomes the big brother. Will the former big brothers join hands again? This is a question worth pondering. Peace and dialogue are the main theme; war tears apart people’s hearts, and people’s hearts can never be in harmony.
