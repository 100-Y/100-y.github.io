2023/11/20在一片高高的雪山之上，有一群嬉戏打闹的孩子。其中，有位年龄与我相符的女子。一行人，有说有笑，诉说雪山的美丽和纯洁。这不是第一次出现这样的情况，站在高耸的山峰之中，四处都是让双眼睁不开的白色积雪。  
  
\- On top of a high snow-covered mountain, there was a group of playful children. Among them, there was a woman whose age matched mine. The group, talking and laughing, spoke of the beauty and purity of the snowy mountains. This is not the first time that I have been in such a situation, standing in the midst of towering peaks, surrounded by white snow that makes it hard to open my eyes.  
  
恐高与眼盲的我，想快速逃离。尝试询问ta们，有无快速下山的小道。回答到：黄颜色的土壤。我并没有很多耐心去寻找。顺着雪山的沟壑和阶梯往下，纵横驰骋……  
  
\- Fear of heights and blindness, I wanted to escape quickly. Tried asking them if there was a quick trail down the mountain. The answer came: yellow colored soil. I didn’t have a lot of patience to look for it. Down the snowy mountain gullies and steps, gallop criss-crossing ……  
  
滑行与跳跃在不羁的雪山，很快便看到黄颜色的宽阔道路。道路通向周边的民居。在这里，再次碰见归家的年龄相符的女子。询问后才得知，ta们莫名在梦里，被困在雪山多次。不知“现实”是否仍旧如梦，只当人生真切的感受和经历。  
  
\- Sliding and jumping over the unruly snowy mountains, I soon saw the wide yellow colored road. The road leads to the neighboring homes. Here, once again, i bumped into age-matched women returning home. After inquiring about them, they had been stranded in the snowy mountains many times in their dreams. And don’t know if the “reality” is still like a dream, but only as a real feeling and experience in life.  
  
提出，梦中再次相遇，同时对应说出“你也在这里”的话，会不会迅速绕过虚假的梦境。她欣然同意。  
  
\- I suggested that if we met again in the dream and said the words “You are here too” at the same time, would we quickly bypass the false dream world. She readily agreed.  
  
如果离开，意喻幡然时候的醒悟；一时半刻，我还活在梦中，并未醒来。骑着自行车，继续盲目行驶在未知的旅途。  
  
\- If left, it was a metaphor for waking up in a moment of clarity; for a moment, I was still living in the dream and had not woken up. On my bike, I continue blindly on my journey into the unknown.  
  
穿过下行通道，直到一通电话叫停了我。把车靠停在路边，满心不悦听着对面通话人，叽里呱啦、描述不清的话语。忍不住，最终还是挂了。  
  
\- Crossing the underpass until a phone call stops me. Pulling over to the side of the road, i listened with displeasure to the caller on the other side of the phone, who was rattling on and on, describing the words in an indescribable way. I couldn’t help it, i finally hung up.  
  
望着，护栏里苍茫毫无生机的大地；转过头，车道旁却是四季都绿色的植被。反差之大，形成鲜明的对比。  
  
\- Look, pale lifeless earth in the guardrail; turn head, green vegetation in all seasons in the driveway. The comparison is so great that it forms a stark contrast.  
  
这就恰似，“我”现实中，一生的写照啊！  
  
\- This is just like, “I” in reality, a reflection of life ah!
