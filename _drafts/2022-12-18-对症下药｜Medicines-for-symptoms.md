未经体力消耗阵阵的肌肉疼痛，不曾风寒侵袭导致原因不明的咳嗽，排除空气污染因素造成的上呼吸道感染，正常情况突然短暂的头昏目眩，等一系列身体状况切实的反应，都可能是新冠流行感冒中标的初期体现。

\- Muscle pain without physical exertion, unexplained cough not caused by wind-cold attack, Excluding the upper respiratory tract infection caused by air pollution factors, sudden and brief dizziness under normal circumstances, A series of real responses to physical conditions, etc., may be the initial manifestation of getting the COVID-19 Influenza.

此刻，便需要开始注意，多休息，多喝水，多补充营养，避免症状进一步恶化（纯靠免疫力阶段）。持续一定时间的症状，然后发烧，导致发冷、发热的问题，得及时维持正常的机体环境，物理或药用，升、降温度（主要靠免疫力阶段）。

\- At this moment, need to start paying attention, rest more, drink more water, and supplement more nutrition to avoid further deterioration of symptoms (Purely rely on immunity stage). Symptoms that last for a certain period of time, and then develop a fever, leading to chills and fever problems. It is necessary to maintain a normal body environment in time, and use physical methods or medicine to raise or lower the temperature (Mainly rely on immunity stage).

再，长久、持续不退的高烧情况出现，就要迅速，到诊所、医院就医了。避免，无可挽回突发境地的发生（主要靠药物阶段）。基础病患者，提前一步，修养、用药或就医，或能最大化，保障自己的身体健康安全。

\- Furthermore, if a long-term and persistent high fever occurs, it is necessary to seek medical treatment in a clinic or hospital immediately. Avoid the occurrence of irreversible emergencies (Mainly rely on medicine). Patients with basic diseases, should take a step ahead on Rest More, Medicine or Medical Treatment, can maximize keep their health and safety.

另：抗原检测等，无法排他性、可以造假的表象参考指标。纯纯割韭菜的行为。非医疗专家建议，只个人，对待该有医疗的态度。

\- In addition: antigen detection, etc., as an apparent reference index, cannot be exclusive, and can be falsified. Purely the act of cutting leeks. Not a medical expert recommendation, just personal attitude towards the way of medical treatment should have.
