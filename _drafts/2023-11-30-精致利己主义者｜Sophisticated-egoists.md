2023/11/30精致利己主义者，指的是那些，通过和操纵ta人感同身受的心理与支持，以反哺和达到自己“狭隘且自私”的功利与目的。反而将ta人的一系列声援行为，看作理所应当的付出与馈赠，甚至嘲弄。至于报答，更是一丝没有。

\- Sophisticated egoists refers to those who, through empathy and manipulation of others’ psychology and support, feed back and achieve their “narrow and selfish” utilitarian purposes. Instead, they regard a series of supportive actions from others as a matter of course and even mock them. As for repayment, there is not a bit at all.
