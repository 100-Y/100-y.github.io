每一场变革和运动之中的个人，都是渺小的。

\- Individual in every change and movement, is insignificant.

于是，有的团结在一起，出卖ta人，或被迫，或心不甘、情不愿，目的，都是为了能够保全自己。人性求生和软弱的特性，尽显无余。这原本无可厚非，可有的人，磨灭人性之后，成了魔鬼：便是所有祭祀者的悲哀和结局。

\- Therefore, some of them unite and betray others, or are forced, or unwillingly, for the purpose of preserving themselves. The human nature of survival and weakness is fully revealed. This is originally understandable, but some people, after erasing their humanity, become demons: that is the sorrow and end of all sacrificers.

愿所有真诚、善良的人，在历史的洪流中都能维持本性，都有能力保全自己和ta的家人。

\- May all sincere and kind people maintain their nature in the torrent of history, and have the ability to protect themselves and their families.
