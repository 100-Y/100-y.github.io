屏蔽、拦截，禁言、封号、炸群，请喝茶、拘留、判刑。相关单位，一套熟悉的处理流程下来，压得众人不敢抬起头，人人自危。为了各自利益和寻求自保，选择出卖甚至背叛，更是家常便饭。

\- Screening, blocking, muting, banning accounts, bombing groups, drinking tea please, detaining, and sentencing. Relevant units, after a set of familiar processing procedures, pressured everyone dared not to raise their heads and felt insecure. For own interests and seeking self-protection, choosing to sell or even betray is more commonplace.

何时，这条通天的枷锁，去除；何时，中国人民，才算是真的站起来了！

\- When, this shackle to heaven removed; when, the Chinese people truly stand up!
