2024/02/18讽反，指槐骂桑。这一变奏，也是逐渐发展到“低级红”的过程。至于所谓的“高级红”（不过自身纯正面宣传的描述手法，加之外部纯反面教材的提及），只需将“讽反”的时针，调至顺时针的方向，坚定站稳立场的角度问题。

\- Satire and to criticize indirectly. This variation is also a gradual development to the process of 'low-level redden'. As for the so-called 'high-level redden' (nothing more than a description method of pure positive propaganda, plus the mention of pure negative teaching materials from the outside), it only needs to adjust the 'satire' hour hand to the clockwise direction, a matter of firmly standing on the ground.

反证法。内部于外“低级黑”的提及，过渡到对外部“高级红”的证明，实则也是一种反串“高级黑”的变奏。

\- Method of contradiction. The mention of 'low-level blacken' inside of outside, transitioning to the proof of 'high-level redden' of outside, is actually also a variation of 'high-level blacken' in disguise.
