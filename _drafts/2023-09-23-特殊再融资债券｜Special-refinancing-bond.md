2023/09/23吃你的，拉的屎还要你消化。

\- Eat your food, and you have to digest the shit.

地方债务或中央资金（主要是债务），转到“股市”和“银行”。股市和银行，要求承担吸收大众存款（主要单向）与存款挪用保底的作用，具有明显“崩溃和暴雷”的迹象。勿当接盘侠，勿“一个篮子打水”。（个人意见、仅供参考）

\- Local debt or central funds (mainly debt) are transferred to the “stock market” and “banks”. The stock market and banks, which are required to undertake the role of absorbing public deposits (mainly one-way) and deposit misappropriation for guarantee, have obvious signs of “collapse and thunderstorm”. Do not be the catcher, do not “draw water in one basket”. (personal opinion, for reference only).

当“一个人的欠债”越滚越多，还不起的时候。一个，要么是不还了，彻底摆烂；另一个可能就是，继续尝试寻找“潜在、听话的债主”，然后不断给ta们“画新的大饼”。

\- When “one person’s debt” rolls more and more, can not afford to pay. One, is either not to pay it back, and ruin it completely; the other, is to keep trying to find “potential, obedient creditors” and keep “drawing new cakes” for them.

归根结底，还是“人吃人”的老问题。存款变理财，存款变保险。目的是为了进股市，填一部分债券的大坑。被强制“买债券”的“自己人”，反过来又将居民存款强制送进了股市。

\- In the final analysis, it is still an old problem of "cannibalism". Deposits become financial management, deposits become insurance. The aim is to enter the stock market and fill in a large hole in some bonds. “Own people" who are forced to "buy bonds", in turn, force residents' deposits into the stock market.
