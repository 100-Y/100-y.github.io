太监由生到死，都以为阉割、迫害ta们的人，是别有用心、不怀好意的人群；而恩赐家伙、饭钱的皇权，才压根是ta们真正的主子。

\- From birth to death, eunuchs always thought that the people who castrated and persecuted them were those with ulterior motives and ill intentions; while the imperial power that bestowed them with tools and food money was their true master.

于是，竭力、卖命地为皇权呼喊，便也就理所当然，成了ta们最引以为傲的事业。

\- Therefore, it is only natural for them to shout for the imperial power with all their might and sell their lives, and it has become their proudest career.
