梦见还算亲戚却有点敌对关系的某某人，独自一人的死亡……梦见一个本不应该在某处的某个人，重复做着这个人在别处的这人，已经完成的事情。

\- Dreamed of someone who was a relative but had a bit of a hostile relationship, dying alone… Dreamed of someone who shouldn’t have been somewhere, repeating what this person had done elsewhere, which this person had already completed.

梦见这个某个人，它冲我笑，我一边瞥看它和别处的这人，一边回头发现：提前报备有情况出现需要特地守候的亲戚，巧不巧刚好走开。梦见我大声呼喊！却发不出任何声音……联想到某某人的死亡，接下来某某人极有可能换做是我，瞬间被吓醒了！

\- Dreamed of this someone, it smiled at me, I glanced at it and the other this person elsewhere, and turned back to find: the relative who had reported in advance that there was a situation that needed to be specially waited for, happened to leave. Dreamed of me shouting loudly! But couldn’t make any sound… Thinking of someone’s death, next someone is very likely to be me, and I was instantly awakened!

求生意识强烈……

\- Strong survival instinct…

我曾经梦见过——我冷静地看着：另一个自己的死亡。

\- I once dreamed of – I calmly watched: the death of another me.
