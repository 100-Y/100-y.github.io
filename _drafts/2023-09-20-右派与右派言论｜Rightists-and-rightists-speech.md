2023/09/20右派——新中国，最具有朝气和活力的一代人，也是遭受压迫和打击最为残酷的一批。从那之后，中国人“骨子里百折不挠的精神”逐渐变了、没了。

\- Rightists – the most energetic and vibrant generation of New China, and also the most cruelly oppressed and persecuted. Since then, the “unyielding spirit in the bones” of the Chinese people has gradually changed and disappeared.

右派言论：过往“每一条的右派言论”，如今仍旧能轻易，触动审核员以及背后“高层”的g点。时代大步向前，可人的思想，依然还停留在七十年前。

\- Rightist speech: The past “every rightist speech” can still easily touch the g-point of the reviewers and the “high-level” behind them. The times are moving forward, but people’s thoughts are still stuck in 70 years ago.

比如：新闻、言论自由的问题……（高等学校右派言论选编）

\- For example: the issue of freedom of news and speech… (Selected Rightist Speeches from Higher Education Institutions)

相关“个人、机构或组织”，一套“引蛇出洞”的组合拳下来，新中国第一次“文艺复兴”（百家争鸣）的大好局面和前进脚步，便戛然而止。这一历史所造成的巨大影响和伤害，时至今日，未来、亦不见其停歇……

\- Under a combination of punches that “lure the snake out of the hole” of relevant “person, institution or organization” Individuals, institutions or organizations, the great situation and progress of the first “Renaissance” (a hundred schools of thought) of New China came to an abrupt halt. The huge impact and damage caused by this history, to this day, in the future, will not stop…

右派与右派言论。可谓第一批“本土清醒者”。当“清醒者”倒下，譬如“大跃进”、“文革”等惨烈人祸，便接踵而来。

\- Rightists and Rightists speech. Can be called the first batch of “Native awakened ones”. When the “awakened ones” fell, such as the “Great Leap Forward”, the “Cultural Revolution” and other tragic man-made disasters, then followed one after another。
