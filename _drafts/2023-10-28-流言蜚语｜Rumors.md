2023/10/28浮于台面的流言蜚语，并不可怕。在大众之间广泛散播的，止不住的刺激情绪和私下讨论，会加倍使人感到恐惧。

\- Rumors that floating on the table, are not terrible. The incessant stimulating emotions and private discussions, spread widely among the general public, will doubly frighten the people.

有的人虽然他还活着，可已经彻彻底底输给去世的人了。

- Some people although they are still alive, but have completely lost to the dead.
