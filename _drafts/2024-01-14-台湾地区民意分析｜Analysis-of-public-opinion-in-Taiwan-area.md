2024/01/14根据选举的结果而言，目前至少60%的维持现状，即“不统不独”。且最多33.5%的“统派”（一中各表）和最多40%的“独派”（一中单边）。

\- According to the election results, at least 60% currently maintain the status quo, that is, "neither unification nor independence". And up to 33.5% are "pro-unification" (one China, respective interpretations) and up to 40% are "pro-independence" (one China, unilateral).

故，民进党不广泛代表台湾地区民意的结论。是正确的！

\- Therefore, the conclusion that the Democratic Progressive Party does not widely represent the public opinion of Taiwan area is correct!
