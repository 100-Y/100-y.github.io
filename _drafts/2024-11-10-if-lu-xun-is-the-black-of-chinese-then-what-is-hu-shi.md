将鲁迅视作“支黑”，无非是在他冷峻、批判的文字里捕捉到了一种直面民族弊病的决绝态度——如同医者的锐利刀锋，切割出一片自我剖析的伤口，让民族能见血、见骨。而胡适呢？他或许是“支灰”。不同于鲁迅的尖锐反叛，胡适倾向温和的改良与包容的西化。胡适主张渐进地改变现实，既认可传统价值，又大胆接纳西方文明。他的姿态像是温吞的灰色，似远不似近的幽暗。他不摧毁，而是温柔劝解；不怒目相视，而是和颜而对。

他与鲁迅之间的差异就如一幅光影对比鲜明的油画：鲁迅是浓烈的黑，深刻而不可妥协；胡适则是柔和的灰，既保留了东方的意象，又允许外来思想的渗透。

To regard Lu Xun as the "the black of Chinese" is merely to capture, in his cold and critical writings, a decisive attitude towards confronting the nation's ailments — like the sharp scalpel of a doctor, cutting open a wound of self-analysis that allows the nation to see its blood and bones. But what about Hu Shi? Perhaps he is "the gray of Chinese." Unlike Lu Xun's sharp rebellion, Hu Shi leaned towards gentle reform and a tolerant Westernization. Hu Shi advocated for gradual change, recognizing traditional values while boldly accepting Western civilization. His stance resembles a subdued gray, a dimness that feels distant yet close. He did not destroy, but gently persuaded; he did not glare in anger, but responded with a friendly face.

The difference between him and Lu Xun is like a vivid oil painting of contrasting light and shadow: Lu Xun is a deep, uncompromising black, while Hu Shi is a soft gray, preserving Eastern imagery while allowing foreign ideas to seep in.
