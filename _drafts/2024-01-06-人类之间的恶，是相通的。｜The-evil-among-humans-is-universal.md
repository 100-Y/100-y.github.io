2024/01/06人类之间的恶，是指人类在追求自身利益或满足欲望时，对他人或社会造成的伤害或不公。这种恶的表现形式有很多，如暴力、欺诈、剥削、侵犯、腐败等。

\- The evil among humans, refers to the harm or injustice caused to others or society, when humans pursue their own interests or satisfy their desires. This evil manifests in many forms, such as violence, deception, exploitation, infringement, corruption, etc.

人类之间的恶，是相通的，是指人类的恶具有普遍性和共性。无论是哪个国家、哪个民族、哪个阶层、哪个时代，都存在着人类的恶。人类的恶也具有相似性和传染性，即人类的恶往往受到他人或环境的影响，而且会影响他人或环境，形成恶的循环。

\- The evil among humans, is universal, meaning that human evil has universality and commonality. No matter which country, ethnicity, class, or era, human evil exists. Human evil also has similarity and contagion, that is, human evil is often influenced by others or the environment, and it will affect others or the environment, forming a cycle of evil.

人类之间的恶，是相通的，也意味着人类的恶是可以认识和克服的。人类的恶并非天生或必然，而是由于人类的无知、贪婪、自私、愚昧等原因造成的。人类有理性和道德，有能力通过学习、思考、反省、改正等方式，来克制和减少自身的恶，也有责任通过法律、教育、文化等方式，来制止和防止他人的恶，从而促进人类的进步和和谐。

\- The evil among humans, is universal, which also means that human evil can be understood and overcome. Human evil is not innate or inevitable, but is caused by human ignorance, greed, selfishness, and stupidity. Humans have rationality and morality, have the ability to restrain and reduce their own evil through learning, thinking, introspection, correction, etc., and have the responsibility to stop and prevent the evil of others through law, education, culture, etc., thereby promoting human progress and harmony.

人类之间的恶，是相通的，这是一种对人性的深刻洞察，也是一种对人类命运的警醒和呼唤。我们不能忽视或逃避人类的恶，也不能沉溺或陶醉于人类的恶，而应该正视和对抗人类的恶，也应该追求和实现人类的善。只有这样，我们才能真正实现人的尊严和价值，才能真正建设一个美好的世界。

\- The evil among humans, is universal, which is a profound insight into human nature, and a warning and call for human destiny. We cannot ignore or evade human evil, nor can we indulge or revel in human evil, but should face and confront human evil, and should pursue and achieve human goodness. Only in this way, can we truly realize human dignity and value, and truly build a beautiful world.
