2024/01/09“象牙塔”里，不谙世事的顶尖人物；亦是，傻白甜群体中，“知行合一”的典型代表。

\- In the 'ivory tower', top figures who are ignorant of worldly affairs; also the typical representatives of 'unity of knowledge and action' in the group of 'naive and sweet' people.

国内，这样顶尖人物的典型代表，有：张雪峰和董明珠。国外：特朗普与……。（平等扫射和致敬，每一个人及其所在的群体）

\- In China, typical representatives of such top figures include Zhang Xuefeng and Dong Mingzhu. Abroad, there are Trump and others... (Equal shots and tributes to every individual and their group)

象牙塔：引申义，约等于傻白甜。不单指，现实社会隔绝的学术环境或精神世界，专注于理论研究而不关心实际问题的学者或知识分子；囊括，各行各业，以及行业中“自以为是、沾沾自喜、不思进取”的精英和领袖。

\- Ivory Tower: In its extended meaning, it is roughly equivalent to 'naive and sweet'. It does not only refer to, the academic environment or spiritual world isolated from the real society, scholars or intellectuals who focus on theoretical research and do not care about practical problems; it also includes the 'self-righteous, complacent, and unprogressive' elites and leaders in all walks of life.

知行合一：同，“象牙塔”释义。“不谙世事”的既定前提和预期改善，与“知行合一”的盲目结果和预设立场，互为因果关系。知行合一，原义：知是行的指导，行是知的检验，只有在实践中才能达到“致良知”的境界。不谙世事，原义：形容一个人对社会上的种种事情没有了解，缺乏社会经验。

\- Unity of Knowledge and Action: The same as the interpretation of 'Ivory Tower'. The established premise of 'ignorance of worldly affairs' and the expected improvement are causally related to the blind results and preset positions of 'unity of knowledge and action'. Unity of Knowledge and Action, originally means: knowledge is the guide of action, and action is the test of knowledge, only in practice can we reach the realm of 'achieving good knowledge'. Ignorance of worldly affairs, originally means: it describes a person who does not understand various things in society and lacks social experience.
