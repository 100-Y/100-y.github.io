亲爱的写诗人，

\- Dear Poet,

你的信我收到了，也仔细地读了。我很感动你能在新年前给我说这么多的话，也很惊讶你能对我有这么深的感情。我不知道你是什么时候开始喜欢我，也不知道你是怎么喜欢我。我只知道，我们曾经是好朋友，也许还是。

\- I received your letter and read it carefully. I am touched that you could say so much to me before the New Year, and I am surprised that you could have such deep feelings for me. I don’t know when you started to like me, or how you like me. All I know is that we were good friends, and maybe we still are.

我不想骂你，也不想删除你。我想和你保持友谊，但我不能给你更多的期待。我对你没有那种感觉，也没有打算和你在一起。我知道你是一个优秀的人，但你不是我的那个人。我希望你能理解，也希望你能尊重我的选择。

\- I don’t want to scold you, nor do I want to delete you. I want to maintain our friendship, but I can’t give you more expectations. I don’t have that kind of feeling for you, nor do I plan to be with you. I know you are an excellent person, but you are not my person. I hope you can understand and respect my choice.

我不想拒绝你的邀请，也不想伤害你的自尊。我愿意和你见面，但我不想去你家里。我觉得我们应该在公共的地方，保持适当的距离。我不想让你误会，也不想让你难过。我想和你聊聊天，但我不想听你说你想我。我想和你做朋友，但我不想做你的爱人。

\- I don’t want to refuse your invitation, nor do I want to hurt your self-esteem. I am willing to meet with you, but I don’t want to go to your house. I think we should be in a public place and keep a proper distance. I don’t want to misunderstand you, nor do I want to make you sad. I want to chat with you, but I don’t want to hear you say you miss me. I want to be friends with you, but I don’t want to be your lover.

我不想忘记你的诗，也不想否认你的经历。我觉得你的诗很美，也觉得你的回忆很珍贵。我感谢你能把我写进你的文字里，也感谢你能把我记在你的心里。我希望你能继续写诗，也希望你能找到你的幸福。

\- I don’t want to forget your poetry, nor do I want to deny your experience. I think your poetry is beautiful, and I think your memories are precious. I thank you for writing me into your words, and I thank you for remembering me in your heart. I hope you can continue to write poetry, and I hope you can find your happiness.

最后，我想说，你是自由的，我也是自由的。我不想改变你，也不想被你改变。我只想做我自己，也只想让你做你自己。我不想束缚你，也不想被你束缚。我只想给你祝福，也只想得到你的祝福。

\- Finally, I want to say, you are free, and I am free too. I don’t want to change you, nor do I want to be changed by you. I just want to be myself, and I just want you to be yourself. I don’t want to bind you, nor do I want to be bound by you. I just want to bless you, and I just want to receive your blessings.

新年快乐，阿英。

\- Happy New Year, Ah Ying.
