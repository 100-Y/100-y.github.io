如果非要探讨毛泽东与邓小平的“功和过”。邓的“过”是三分，那么毛就是满十；毛的“功”是七，那么邓便是十四。而后继者，无非都是在消耗或是增加，二者各自的“红利”。

\- If we must discuss the “merits and demerits” of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. If Deng’s “demerit” is three points, then Mao’s is ten; if Mao’s “merit” is seven, then Deng’s is fourteen. And the successors are all consuming or increasing the “dividends” of the two.

将“功”与“过”作比对，显然是在抬高或是贬低另一个，那不是正确的比法。好的比好的，坏的比坏的，才是在同一赛道进行公平的竞争。

\- Comparing “merits” with “demerits” is obviously raising or belittling the other, which is not the correct way to compare. Good is compared with good, bad is compared with bad, which is fair competition on the same track.

毛最大的“功”也是“过”，在于能无情革“ta人”的命，却也唯独少了真正革“自己”的。俗话讲：英雄没有弱点。这也是循环土壤的根源，更是“某党”赖以生存的基石。完全否定毛，也就等于彻底否定了自己。这属于是自我了断的行为。

\- Mao’s greatest “merit” and “demerit” lies in his ability to ruthlessly change the lives of others, but he also lacks the ability to truly change himself. As the saying goes: heroes have no weaknesses. This is the root of the cycle of soil and the cornerstone of the survival of a certain party. To completely deny Mao is to completely deny oneself. This is an act of self-destruction.

邓也循着这样一个基石。1976年天安门广场的反革命政治事件，当时的“皇帝”，仍旧还姓毛。而邓后来借此的第三次上位，和89年的第四次引退，再至92年的最后出山。才根本上结束了，这样一种“秦皇汉武”的政治生态。

\- Deng also followed this foundation. The anti-revolutionary political incident in Tiananmen Square in 1976, when the “emperor” was still surnamed Mao. And Deng’s subsequent third ascent to power, his fourth retirement in 1989, and his final return to power in 1992. It was only then that such a political ecology of “Qin Emperor and Han Wu” was fundamentally ended.

邓最大的“功”和“过”，便在于此。没有彻底将政治体制的改革，进行下去。也为如今这样的一个历史循环，埋下伏笔。

\- Deng’s greatest “merit” and “demerit” lies in this. He did not thoroughly carry out political system reform. He also laid the groundwork for such a historical cycle.

比如官员财产的公开，比如信息的透明，比如体制延续的问题……而新的毛党（同时也是改开攫取最大利益的集体），断然拒绝和不再允许，这样一些充满争议的讨论。当然，旧的毛党，要是继续存在，和如今的朝鲜，相信不会有太大的差别。

\- For example, the disclosure of officials’ property, transparency of information, continuation of the system… And the new Maoist party (which is also a collective that has seized the greatest benefits from reform and opening up) resolutely refuses and no longer allows such controversial discussions. Of course, if the old Maoist party continues to exist, it will not be much different from North Korea today.

于是，毛病不改、照毛学习，不再追求“真正革自己命”的某党，又逐渐活成了毛，不过以相对富态的另一种形式存在。这才逐渐培养成了如今这样一种，政治上充满迷惘，社会又不怎么公正的病态。

\- As a result, a certain party that did not change its Maoist ways and continued to learn from Mao without pursuing true self-revolution gradually became Mao again, but in a relatively rich form. This gradually cultivated such a political confusion and social injustice.
