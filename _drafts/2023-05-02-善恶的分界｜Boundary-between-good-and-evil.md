好对坏，不过意愿和违背意愿的一个区别。也是人性善与恶的一个分界。分界点，一边恶的程度；总远远超出，另一边善的高度。

\- Good versus evil is just a difference between willingness and unwillingness. It is also a boundary between human kindness and evil. On the boundary point, the degree of evil on one side; always far exceeds the height of goodness, on the other side.
