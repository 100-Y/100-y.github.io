皇室，身前生后，有数不清的金银财宝……需要管家、仆人看卫：一些人指挥，一些人发号施令。城门，开战前。只有炮兵”，无法享受以上人群所有的权益：须在战时玩命。

\- The royal, in their lifetime, had untold gold and silver … and needed stewards, servants to look after them: some to command, some to give orders. The gates of the city, before start of the war. Only the artillery, which does not enjoy the rights possessed by the above group: must to play for their lives in time of the war.

当玩命的炮兵，身上互相爆出金币；发号施令、指挥的仆人和管家，也都铤而走险。数着铤而走险捡来金币的皇室，满心欢喜，又称方桌游戏的胜利！对应相反，则叫做失败。

\- When artillerymen playing for their lives burst into gold coins with each other. The servants and stewards who gave orders and command, were also desperate. The royal, counting the gold coins the desperate picked up, overjoyed. It is also called victory of the Square Table Games! Opposite, called defeat.

炮兵，都爆金币了；皇室的金银财宝，该有多多。

\- Artillery, even bursting into gold coins; how much gold and silver the royal should have.
