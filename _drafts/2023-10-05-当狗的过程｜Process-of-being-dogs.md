2023/10/05各项充满人生，上好的抉择，也无非是主动当“谁的狗”而已。狗会拆家，遭受虐待，被抛弃；会绝境中存活，肆无忌惮的奔跑，攻击甚至被一些人吃掉。

\- All the choices that fill life, the best ones, are nothing but voluntarily becoming “someone’s dog”. Dogs will destroy the house, suffer abuse, be abandoned; they will survive in desperation, run recklessly, attack and even be eaten by some people.

狗会傻笑，人也一样……受困于“外力”，到自由了“自己”：甘心然后的释然。

\- Dogs will smile foolishly, and so will people… Trapped by “external forces”, to be free of “oneself”: willing and then relieved.
