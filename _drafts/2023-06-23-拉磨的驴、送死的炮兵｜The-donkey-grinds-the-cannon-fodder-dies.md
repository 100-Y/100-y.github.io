体制内拉磨的驴，和战场上送死的炮兵，是一个比喻，用来形容一些为了某种利益或目的而出卖自己的人，或者一些为了完成任务而不顾自己生命的人。

\- The donkey that grinds in the system and the cannon fodder that dies on the battlefield are a metaphor, used to describe some people who sell themselves for some kind of benefit or purpose, or some people who disregard their own lives to complete a task.

体制内拉磨的驴，指的是那些在体制内（比如政府机关、国企、事业单位等）工作的人，他们虽然享受着稳定的收入和福利，但是却没有自由和创造力，只能按照上级的安排和要求去做事，就像一头被套在磨盘上拉磨的驴一样。这种人可能会因为惧怕失去体制内的地位和保障而不敢反抗或者改变，也可能会因为贪图体制内的权力和利益而出卖自己的良心和原则。

\- The donkey that grinds in the system refers to those who work in the system (such as government agencies, state-owned enterprises, public institutions, etc.). They enjoy stable income and benefits, but they have no freedom and creativity. They can only do things according to the arrangements and requirements of their superiors, just like a donkey that is harnessed to a millstone and grinds. These people may be afraid to resist or change because they fear losing their status and security in the system, or they may sell their conscience and principles for the power and interests in the system.

战场上送死的炮兵，指的是那些在战争中被派去执行危险任务的士兵，他们虽然有着保卫国家和民族的理想和信念，但是却面临着随时牺牲生命的风险，就像一颗被发射出去的炮弹一样。这种人可能会因为忠于职守和服从命令而不惜付出生命的代价，也可能会因为被蒙蔽或者利用而成为别人实现目的的工具。

\- The cannon fodder that dies on the battlefield refers to those soldiers who are sent to perform dangerous tasks in war. They have ideals and beliefs of defending the country and the nation, but they face the risk of sacrificing their lives at any time, just like a shell that is fired. These people may be willing to pay the price of life for their loyalty and obedience, or they may be deceived or used as tools for others to achieve their goals.

这个比喻可能是来源于成语“卸磨杀驴”。“卸磨杀驴”，是指磨完东西后，把拉磨的驴卸下来杀掉，比喻把曾经为自己出过力的人一脚踢开。这个成语，反映了一种利用别人而不知感恩的心态；而“体制内拉磨的驴”和“战场上送死的炮兵”，则反映了一种被利用而不知反抗或者不愿反抗的心态。

\- This metaphor may originate from the idiom “kill the donkey after unloading the millstone”. “Kill the donkey after unloading the millstone” means to kill the donkey that grinds after finishing grinding, implying to kick away someone who has worked hard for oneself. This idiom reflects a mentality of using others without gratitude; while “the donkey that grinds in the system” and “the cannon fodder that dies on the battlefield” reflect a mentality of being used without knowing or unwilling to resist.
