2023/12/04什么是实事求是，就事论事？

\- What is seeking truth from facts, and dealing with matters on their own merits?

“国，是产业；人民，是产业的‘奴仆’。”分析前面这句话。

\- “The country is an industry; the people are the ‘slaves’ of the industry.” Analyze the previous sentence.

要分析这句话，我们可以考虑以下几个方面：

\- To analyze this sentence, we can consider the following aspects:

这句话是一个并列结构，也就是说，它由两个或多个具有相同语法形式和表达相似或对比意思的分句组成。在这里，这句话有两个分句，用分号（;）隔开，每个分句都有“主语，谓语，宾语”的模式。

\- This sentence is a parallel structure, that is, it is composed of two or more clauses with the same grammatical form and expressing similar or contrasting meanings. Here, this sentence has two clauses, separated by a semicolon (;), each clause has the pattern of “subject, predicate, object”.

这句话使用了隐喻，这是一种比喻两个不相似但有某些共同点的事物的修辞手法。在这里，这句话把国家比作产业，把人民比作奴隶，暗示国家是一个剥削人民为自己谋利的大型经济系统。

\- This sentence uses metaphor, which is a rhetorical device that compares two dissimilar things that have some common points. Here, this sentence compares the country to an industry, and the people to slaves, implying that the country is a large economic system that exploits the people for its own profit.

这句话表达了对国家和人民的批判和悲观的看法，暗示国家不关心人民的福祉，而人民没有自由或尊严。在‘奴隶’一词周围使用引号，表示说话者是引用别人的话或使用反讽来强调自己的观点。

\- This sentence expresses a critical and pessimistic view of the country and the people, implying that the country does not care about the welfare of the people, and the people have no freedom or dignity. The use of quotation marks around the word ‘slave’ indicates that the speaker is quoting someone else’s words or using irony to emphasize his own point of view.

同理。分析“法，是家法；‘祖宗’，在家法之上。”

\- Similarly. Analyze “Law is a family law; ‘ancestors’ are above the family law.”

同理。什么是表达意见，尊重意见？对“事”，进行支持或反驳，提出自己的见解，见解没有统一的标准。

\- Similarly. What is expressing opinions, respecting opinions? Support or refute the “matter”, put forward one’s own opinions, opinions do not have a unified standard.
