梦见祭祀，一堆熄灭后的碳火  
有人拿死物在祭祀——魔鬼  
梦见自己再拿……  
自己清晰看到魔鬼的脸  
自己，差点被魔鬼拖去  
魔鬼不知满足，再用鲜血、活物……  
有人手被反绑，躺着、挣扎在骨灰旁  
梦见自己将要松开活人的绑绳  
提前跑路，魔鬼准时来到人间

\- Dreaming of a sacrifice, a pile of extinguished charcoal  
\- Someone taking a dead thing and sacrificing – devil  
\- Dreamed that I took… again  
\- I saw devil’s face clearly  
\- I was almost dragged away by the devil  
\- The devil is not satisfied, uses blood and living things again…  
\- Someone with hands tied behind back, lying and struggling next to ashes  
\- Dreaming that i am about to untie the living being  
\- Running ahead of time, the devil came to earth on time
