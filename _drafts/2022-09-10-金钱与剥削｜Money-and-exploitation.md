一个人单靠能力，是挣不了钱的。搞懂钱的本质，是来源于不同渠道、相同的剥削。也就明白了为什么有些人没钱，有些人却万分有。

\- One cannot make money by relying on one’s ability alone. To understand the nature of money, that it comes from different channels, but the same exploitation. This also explains why some people are poor, while some are extremely rich.

比如公务员，表面上是凭借自己的高分进去，实则领的还是剥削百姓来的赋税。一本万利的生意。又比如教师，固定剥削受教育的学生，付费传播知识。知识本是无价的，同“一开始便没有钱”一样。

\- For example, public servants, who seem to enter by their high scores, actually receive the taxes that exploit the people. A business that makes huge profits. Or teachers, who exploit the students who receive education, and charge fees for spreading knowledge. Knowledge is priceless, just like “there was no money at the beginning.”

再比如经商的个体户，有的人打抱不平了，说ta们赚的都是辛苦钱。没错！ta们也的的确确是。提供消费平台，方便众多客人的同时，但也同等剥削了客人们赚辛苦钱的权利。一些人，不得不转移其它阵地，去剥削其ta的人。道（本）生一，一生二，二本三，三生万物（利）。

\- Or individual business owners, who some people feel sorry for, saying that they earn hard-earned money. That’s right! They really do. They provide a consumption platform, which facilitates many customers, but also equally exploit the customers’ right to earn hard-earned money. Some people have to shift to other positions, to exploit others. The Dao(business) produces One; One produces Two; Two produce Three; Three produce all things (benefits).

与其说，看谁比较能挣钱；不如看，谁更会剥削。

\- Rather than saying, who can make more money; it is better to see, who can exploit more.
