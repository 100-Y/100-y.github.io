听话：是让渡自己权利，开始变得卑微，“人为刀俎我为鱼肉”的第一步。也是，某些人放弃自我灵魂，成为ta人为达某种目的而供之使用工具的，第一步。

\- Obeying: is the first step of giving up one’s rights, becoming humble, and being “the fish and meat on the chopping board of others”. It is also the first step of some people abandoning their own souls, becoming tools for others to use for some purpose.

死而无救！

\- Hopeless!
