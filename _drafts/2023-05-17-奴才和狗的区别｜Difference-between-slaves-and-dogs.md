奴才是人类，狗是动物。  
奴才是人养的，狗是狗生的。  
奴才对主子是一种属于利益的忠，没有利益了，主奴关系也就不存在了；狗对主子是一种发自内心的忠，不随时间而改变。  
奴才可以学，狗是学不来的。  
奴才会“审时度势”，狗只会相随共死。

\- Slaves are human, dogs are animals.  
\- Slaves are raised by humans, dogs are born by dogs.  
\- Slaves are loyal to their masters for a benefit, and without benefit, the master-slave relationship ceases to exist; dogs are loyal to their masters from their hearts, and do not change with time.  
\- Slaves can learn, dogs cannot.  
\- Slaves will “judge the situation”, dogs will only die together.

而狗奴才，指的大概就是结合狗与奴才二者共性，混合后的一个产物吧。

\- And Dog slave, probably refers to a product that combines the commonality of dogs and slaves both and mixes them.
