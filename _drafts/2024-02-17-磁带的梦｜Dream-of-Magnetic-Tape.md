2024/02/17梦里，有人在用嘴舔舐伤口。

\- In the dream, someone was licking a wound with his mouth.

近点，只见那人，不断从伤口里抽出黑色的长线条，像是某种磁带，死物般的存在。抽出的磁带会自动收缩，有一节一截的，更多是连续不断的。好奇心，驱使那人探究，磁带形成的本质原因。由于磁带连续收缩，于是他一边抽取，舔舐伤口的同时，一边休息，寻找工具固定。

\- Closer, I saw that person, constantly pulling out black strips from the wound, like some kind of magnetic tape, a dead thing. The pulled-out tape would automatically shrink, some in segments, more in continuity. Curiosity drove that person to explore the nature of the tape. Because the tape kept shrinking, he pulled it out and licked the wound at the same time, while resting and looking for tools to fix it.

说来也奇怪，伤口并不使他感到疼痛，于他的脸上，甚至开始能，看到愉悦轻松的情感转变。磁带的颜色也逐渐，由深变浅、红转深红。

\- Strangely enough, the wound did not cause him any pain, and on his face, could even see the emotional change of pleasure and relaxation. The color of the tape also gradually changed from dark to light, from red to dark red.

变浅的过程使人身心舒畅，仿佛排泄粪便与尿液，代表，可能印证了磁带存在的终点。转深红的过程，感觉到他的神色和内心，都明显地开始慌张了，意味，身体内的深红血液，与这一外在已经抽取的黑色磁带，是相连着，互有因果关系的。

\- The lightening process made him feel comfortable, as if excreting feces and urine, representing, possibly confirming the end of the tape's existence. The darkening process, can feel his expression and inner state, clearly began to panic, meaning, the deep red blood in their body, and this external black tape that had been extracted, were connected, and had a causal relationship.

正当犹豫不决磁带处理的关头，我准备一把拽过他具有伤口的右手，缩回部分浅色磁带的然后，让他用嘴吸收残留的尿液。

\- Just when undecided about how to deal with the tape, I was ready to grab his right hand with the wound, retract some of the light-colored tape and then let him suck up the remaining urine with his mouth.

无限抽取的东西，不可存在；定不下决心的事，另一个自己却总是能够帮忙做到。

\- Something that can be extracted infinitely cannot exist; something that cannot be decided, another self can always help to do.
