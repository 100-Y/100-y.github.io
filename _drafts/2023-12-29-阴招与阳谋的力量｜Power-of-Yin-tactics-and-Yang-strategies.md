2023/12/29将坏人的个人联系方式或把柄，出卖至境外或境内个人、机构或组织运行的账号，比如反串、钓鱼、诈骗等。让更坏的，来欺负这个坏人。  
  
\- Selling the personal contact information or weaknesses of the bad guys to accounts operated by individuals, institutions, or organizations at home or abroad, such as counterfeiting, phishing, fraud, etc. Let the worse ones bully these bad guys.  
  
但是，这些“阴招”，都不如光明正大、义正言辞地站立在，这些人的面前。也远不及，采用强大的个人力量以及无坚不摧的信念击溃ta们，来的热烈与富有成就感。  
  
\- However, these “Yin tactics” are not as good as standing upright and speaking righteously in front of these people. It is far from using strong personal power and unbreakable beliefs to defeat them, which is more passionate and fulfilling.
