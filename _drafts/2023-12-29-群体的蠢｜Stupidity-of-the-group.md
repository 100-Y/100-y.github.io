2023/12/29远离社会中各式各样、故步自封，放弃学习的“蠢人”。不然，就得被ta们一系列的骚操作，给气死。

\- Stay away from all kinds of “fools” who rest on their laurels and give up their studies. Otherwise, you will be pissed off by a series of coquettish operations by them.

“蠢”，一个人或许是不自知的，在一群人那里，它也许就是“聪明”。个人的蠢，毫无意义；一群人，意义毫无。

\- “Stupid”, a person may not know it, in a group of people, it may be “smart”. Personal stupidity, no meaning; a group of people, meaning no.
