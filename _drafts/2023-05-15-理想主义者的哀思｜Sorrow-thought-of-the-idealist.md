我所引以为傲造就出的“意识和认知”，正是我的“灵魂乃至身体”源源不断痛苦根系的所在。当这些具有成就性质的东西，遭受多重毁灭，我的痛苦，也就一道随之消失了。

\- The ‘consciousness and cognition’ that I take pride in creating, is precisely where the root of my continuous pain lies in my ‘soul and body’. When these things of achievement, are destroyed multiple times, then my pains, also disappear with them.
