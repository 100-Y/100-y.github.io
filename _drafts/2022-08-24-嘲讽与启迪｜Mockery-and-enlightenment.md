启迪，所能迸发出的能量，比嘲讽带来的伤害，要低数十倍……那些受到嘲讽伤害，然后再去伤害ta人的人，愈发地消亡；启迪的大军，才能更牢牢占据住，中心的地位。

\- Enlightenment, the energy that can burst out, is tens of times lower than the harm caused by mockery… Those who are hurt by mockery and then go to hurt others, are increasingly dying out; the army of enlightenment, can more firmly occupy the central position.

底层相互损害， 是统治阶级最乐见其成的事。所谓，良言救不了/不救，该死的鬼，便是这样一个道理。

\- The mutual damage of the bottom layer, is the most pleasing thing for the ruling class. The so-called, good words can not save/do not save, the ghost that deserves to die, is such a truth.
