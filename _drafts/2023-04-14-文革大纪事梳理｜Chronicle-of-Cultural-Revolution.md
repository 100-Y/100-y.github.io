\# \*\*文革理由｜Reasons for the Cultural Revolution\*\*

自由派观点：认为毛泽东的经济政策，在大跃进中遭到惨重失败，结果是数千万人的“非正常死亡”，之后大权旁落，毛不甘权力被架空加上恐惧死后，因为经济的惨烈失败，所以发动文革夺权。

\- Liberal view: Mao Zedong’s economic policies suffered a disastrous failure in the Great Leap Forward, resulting in tens of millions of “abnormal deaths”, and then lost power. Mao was unwilling to be emptied of power and feared that after his death, he would launch the Cultural Revolution to seize power because of the economic failure.

左派观点：认为五年计划完成社会主义改造后，由于在经济建设工作中照搬苏联经验（斯大林模式），体制上存在等级工资制与干部特权等问题，故毛希望通过“大跃进”、“人民公社化运动”与“反右运动”等自上而下的改良来削弱行政官僚摄取的工业化红利。（随着政治体制自身改革的失败，中国官方观点认为，毛决定发动由体制外民众力量推动的“文革”来对抗官僚主义。)

\- Leftist view: After the completion of socialist transformation in the Five-Year Plan, due to the copying of Soviet experience (Stalin model) in economic construction work, there were problems such as hierarchical wage system and cadre privileges in the system. Therefore, Mao hoped to weaken the industrialization dividends captured by administrative bureaucrats through top-down improvements such as the “Great Leap Forward”, “People’s Commune Movement” and “Anti-Rightist Movement”. (With the failure of political system reform itself, the Chinese official view believes that Mao decided to launch a “Cultural Revolution” driven by non-systemic public forces to combat bureaucracy.)

\# \*\*文革背景｜Background of the Cultural Revolution\*\*

一个大的前提，三面红旗与“三年困难时期”。

\- A big premise is the Three Red Flags and the “Three Years of Difficulty”.

1959年4月，国家主席：毛下、刘少奇上。

\- In April 1959, National Chairman: Mao down, Liu Shaoqi up.

1959年7-8月，庐山会议，国防部长：彭德怀下、林彪上。反左批毛（暗指三面红旗的失败等），毛不认为这方面自己有错，或只有“一根指头”，转而反右批彭（意见书）。

\- In July-August 1959, Lushan Conference, Minister of National Defense: Peng Dehuai down, Lin Biao up. Anti-left criticism of Mao (implying the failure of the Three Red Flags, etc.), Mao did not think he was wrong in this regard, or only had “one finger”, and instead turned to anti-right criticism of Peng (opinion book).

困难时期……继续，朝着更严重的方向发展。

\- The difficult period… continues to develop in a more serious direction.

1962年1-2月，七千人大会（三年困难时期的，再总结）：得益于林的拥护和支持，使毛看到了“谁是敌人，谁是朋友”，从而为文革阶级阵线，打下基础。

\- In January-February 1962, the 7,000-person conference (a summary of the three years of difficulty): Thanks to Lin’s support and support, Mao saw “who is the enemy and who is a friend”, laying the foundation for the class line of the Cultural Revolution.

1964年，林的《毛主席语录》，开始在军中发行。

\- In 1964, Lin’s “Quotations from Chairman Mao” began to be distributed in the army.

1965年1月，国家主席：刘少奇再次当选。（第三届全国人民代表大会，可谓毛决定发动文革最直接的导火索）

\- In January 1965, National Chairman: Liu Shaoqi was re-elected. (The Third National People’s Congress can be said to be the most direct fuse for Mao’s decision to launch the Cultural Revolution)

\# \*\*文革开始｜The Cultural Revolution begins\*\*

\### \*\*第一阶段｜Phase One\*\*

1966年5月，516通知、大字报等……反右全面开始。（至此，毛重新回到权力的第一把交椅）

\- In May 1966, 516 notifications, big-character posters, etc… Anti-rightist movement began in full swing. (At this point, Mao returned to the first seat of power)

1969年4月，林成为二把手。

\- In April 1969, Lin became second-in-command.

1970年8-9月，庐山会议：林在会上没有点名的批评，毛被触怒。毛和林，开始反目。

\- In August-September 1970, Lushan Conference: Lin did not criticize by name at the meeting and Mao was angered. Mao and Lin began to turn against each other.

1971年9月8日，林夺权失败，出逃、殒命。

\- On September 8th 1971, Lin failed to seize power and fled and died.

\### \*\*第二阶段｜Phase Two\*\*

文革继续：江青上，邓小平复出……邓小平三下

\- The Cultural Revolution continues: Jiang Qing up and Deng Xiaoping returns… Deng Xiaoping down third time

\# \*\*文革结束｜End of the Cultural Revolution\*\*

江下……邓上

\- Jiang down… Deng up

\# \*\*小结｜Summary\*\*

没有“三年困难时期”毛自身犯的错误，加上没有“林”等其它的支持和帮助，也依然会有毛后来成功发动的文革？这是反驳左派观点最有利的论据。又1965年1月，国家主席，若是毛重新当选，会不会发生转变，或者更声势浩大的运动又将展开？

\- Without Mao’s own mistakes during the “Three Years of Difficulty” and without support and help from others such as “Lin”, would there still have been a successful Cultural Revolution launched by Mao later? This is the most favorable argument for refuting leftist views. And in January 1965, if Mao was re-elected as national chairman, would there have been a change or would a more powerful movement have unfolded?

唯一值得欣慰的是，当时与会的大会代表们，至少大部分人的眼睛，仍还是雪亮的！

\- The only consolation is that at least most of the delegates present at that time still had bright eyes!
