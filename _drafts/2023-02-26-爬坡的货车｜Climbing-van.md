梦见搭乘一辆爬坡的货车……溜到一块，城建外观十分不错、相当齐整且装饰豪华、美丽大方的，西域荒漠城外街。下车拍照纪念，微信上云同步收藏。

\- Dreaming of riding in a climbing van… Slipping into a piece of outer streets of Western Desert City, appearance of the city that is very nice and quite neat and lavishly and beautifully decorated. Get off the van and take photos to commemorate the occasion, and sync collection on WeChat in cloud.

白天，这里有自然奇特的旖旎风光，街道偶尔只能看见衣衫褴褛路过的穷人。太阳下山，黑暗城市阴影开始逐渐显现，出行的人们，直至笼罩整块都市……

\- During the day, there are natural wonders of beauty, the streets are occasionally filled with poor people passing by in rags. As the sun goes down, the dark city shadows begin to appear, the people travel, until the whole city is covered ……

让人背觉恐怖的，从不是善变的自然；而是那些相同却毫无交集的人类，苟活……罪恶里滋生，使得ta们面目全非。

\- It is never the fickle nature that makes people back feel horrible; but the same unconnected human beings who drift through life… live in sin, that makes them a complete different of face.
