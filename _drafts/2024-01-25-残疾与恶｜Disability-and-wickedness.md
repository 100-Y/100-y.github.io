2024/01/25“残疾人”意识不到自己的“残疾”，是“残疾”么？答案：肯定的是。这与“恶人意识不到自己的恶，是恶。”是一样的。“残疾”或“恶”，不是一成不变，而是动态发展与不稳定的。人或事物，相对完美和善，存在的同时；一并不断充斥着，残疾与恶，惊险的历程。

\- Is it a disability if a person with a disability is not aware of their own disability? The answer is absolutely yes. This is the same as “a wicked person who is not aware of their own wickedness is wicked.” Disability or wickedness is not static, but dynamic and unstable. People or things, relatively perfect and good, exist at the same time; they are constantly filled with disability and wickedness, a thrilling journey.
