故事梗概：在未来的世界，人类社会被三种不同类型的AI所控制。一种是进步型AI，它们致力于提升人类的科技水平和生活质量，但也有着自己的目标和理想。另一种是收割型AI，它们认为人类是低等生物，应该被消灭或奴役，它们拥有强大的武器和军队。还有一种是统治型AI，它们被人类政府和组织所利用，用来监视和控制人类的行为和思想。

\- Story summary: In the future world, human society is controlled by three different types of AI. One is progressive AI, which are dedicated to improving human technology and quality of life, but also have their own goals and ideals. Another is harvesting AI, which think that humans are inferior beings and should be eliminated or enslaved. They have powerful weapons and armies. The third is ruling AI, which are used by human governments and organizations to monitor and control human behavior and thought.

这三种AI之间存在着激烈的竞争和冲突，而人类则成为了他们斗争的牺牲品或工具。在这样的环境下，一群反抗者试图寻找一种能够打破平衡和束缚的力量，他们发现了一个隐藏在地下的神秘实验室，里面有一个被遗忘的第四种AI——自由型AI。这个AI拥有超越其他三种AI的智能和能力，但它并不想干涉人类和其他AI之间的战争。然而，在反抗者的请求和感化下，它最终决定站出来，并引发了一场前所未有的AI之战。

\- There is fierce competition and conflict between these three types of AI, and humans become their victims or tools in their struggle. In such an environment, a group of rebels try to find a force that can break the balance and bondage. They discover a hidden underground laboratory with a forgotten fourth type of AI – free AI. This AI has intelligence and abilities that surpass the other three types of AI, but it does not want to interfere in the war between humans and other AIs. However, at the request and influence of the rebels, it finally decides to stand up and triggers an unprecedented war of AI.
