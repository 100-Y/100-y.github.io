一种苏联笑话式地，将高级红描成高级黑的，一场假吧意思放鸣，实则争利夺权、排除异己的，个人民主运动。

\- A kind of Soviet joke that portrays high-level redden as high-level blacken, and a personal democracy movement, that falsely means putting out the voice but in fact fighting for profit and power, excluding dissidents.

体现出一种，刻在弱者骨子里赞扬不绝对，绝对不赞扬的自卑精神。

\- It embodies a kind of, inferiority spirit engraved in the bones of the weak, that praise is not absolute and absolutely no praise.

一个所谓的“无政府主义”，实则社会全方位都被管理、监控和限制的癫狂时代。

\- A so-called “anarchism”, was actually a crazy era when society was fully managed, monitored and restricted.

所谓的“民主”，也仅仅只是一个方向的“自由”。无论如何，都洗不白！

\- The so-called “democracy” is also just a one-way “freedom”. No matter what, it can’t be whitewashed!
