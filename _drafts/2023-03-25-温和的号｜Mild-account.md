温和的号，但只要也是触犯到一部分激进组织，比如：说“鸡蛋”无论怎样就是好吃的“小粉红或爱国大v”，也可以导致被封。根源是，话语权的进一步压缩，需要统一被转移到声量更大的群体之上。  
  
\- A mild account, but as long as it also touches some radical organizations, such as ‘little pink or patriotic big V’ saying that ‘eggs’ are always delicious, it can also lead to being blocked. The root cause is that, the further compression of the right to speak, needs to be transferred to a group with a larger voice.  
  
为了达成那个既定的民族共同奋斗目标，路上所有的绊脚石，都得一一挪开。  
  
\- In order to achieve that established national common struggle goal, all the stumbling blocks on the road, must be moved one by one.
