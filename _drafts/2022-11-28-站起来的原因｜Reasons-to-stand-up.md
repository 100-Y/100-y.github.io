抖音（泛指），站队踩刹车一派；不像微博，话语权，全在狂热粉红一边。当刹车，被彻底拔掉；便是抖音，被独裁的当天。随之而来漫长的黑夜，将成为所有人的明天。

\- Douyin (General reference) is on the side of the brake pedal faction; unlike Weibo, where the right to speak is all on the side of the fanatical pink. When the brake pedal is completely removed, it will be the day when Douyin is ruled by dictatorship. The long night that follows will become everyone’s tomorrow.

这便是很多人选择站起来的原因！

\- This is why many people choose to stand up!
