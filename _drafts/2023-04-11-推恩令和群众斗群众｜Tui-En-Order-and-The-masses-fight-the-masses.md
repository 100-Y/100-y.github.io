推恩令是一种利用诸侯王的子弟之间的矛盾，分化和削弱他们势力的政策。  
  
\- The Tui En Order is a policy that uses the contradictions between the sons of the princes to divide and weaken their power.  
  
推恩令的核心，就是推翻之前诸侯王的家产只能由嫡子一人继承的规矩，改由只要是诸侯王的儿子，哪怕你是私生子，只要得到朝廷的认可，你就能分一碗羹，得到一块属于自己的土地和朝廷认可的封国。  
  
\- The core of the Tui En Order is to overthrow the previous rule that the family property of the princes can only be inherited by one person, and change it so that as long as you are a son of a prince, even if you are an illegitimate child, as long as you are recognized by the court, you can get a share and get a piece of land and a recognized country.  
  
这样，诸侯王的封地就会越分越小，而新封的侯国不再受王国管辖，直接由各郡来管理。这使得诸侯王被变相削藩，避免激起诸侯反抗的可能。  
  
\- In this way, the fiefdoms of the princes will become smaller and smaller, and the newly sealed marquisates will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the kingdom and will be directly managed by each county. This makes it possible for the princes to be cut off in disguise and avoid the possibility of rebellion.  
  
这种政策就像是让群众斗群众，让诸侯王自己消耗自己的力量，从而达到中央集权的目的。  
  
\- This policy is like letting the masses fight against each other, allowing the princes to consume their own strength and achieve the goal of centralization.
