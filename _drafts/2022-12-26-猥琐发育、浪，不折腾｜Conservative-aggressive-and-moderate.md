猥琐发育，是保守，比如胡锦涛、温家宝；浪，是激进，比如毛泽东和习近平。无底线的保守，是软蛋；无底线的激进，则是莽夫。选择一个人无底线地浪，还是一群人无底线地猥琐发育？答案非常明显。

\- Focus on development means conservative, such as Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao; Proactive Attack means aggressive, such as Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping. A conservative without a bottom line is a coward; and a aggressive without a bottom line is a reckless man. Choose a person’s bottomless line to Proactive Attack or a group of people’s bottomless line to focus on development? The answer is very obvious.

选择“不折腾！”故，所有领导中我最钦佩的，是邓小平。

\- Choose “Moderate!”. Therefore, among all leaders I admire, is Deng Xiaoping.
