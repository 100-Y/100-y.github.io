权力不是利剑，而是一缕会呼吸的雾；不是暴君，而是体贴的舞者；不是毁灭规则，而是诱导规则自我演变。在灰色的绸缎之上，它裁剪制度，粉饰语言，试探人心，最终不露痕迹地篡改了边界。

Power is not a sword, but a wisp of breathing mist; not a tyrant, but a considerate dancer; not a destroyer of rules, but a seducer that leads them to evolve on their own. Upon gray satin, it tailors institutions, embellishes language, tests the hearts of people, and in the end, quietly alters the boundaries without leaving a trace.
