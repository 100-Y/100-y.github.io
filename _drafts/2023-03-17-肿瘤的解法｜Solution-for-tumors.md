“肿瘤”，最粗暴的良性解决方法，是让占着茅坑已经拉不了太多屎的人，荣归故里、告老还乡，然后ta们的财富进行半路的“截杀”和“重新分配”。继而，层出不穷分配问题的出现；再“教育”……寻找替代一切的“工作”，让“性质”发生根本上的转变，从而改造所有人的“命”……

\- “Tumors”, the most brutal benign solution is to let people who can’t shit too much in the pit return to their hometowns and retire, and their wealth been intercepted and redistributed halfway. Then, the emergence of endless distribution problems; then education… looking for “work” that replaces everything, allowing the “nature” to undergo fundamental changes, thereby transforming everyone’s “fate”…

两者都不太可能。无人甘愿放弃既得不属于自己的利益，无人莫不更多地想要。前者慢性集体自杀，后者社会全方位的动荡。人性欲望的沟壑，无法被填平。教育，始终赶不上变革的速度！那么“加速”，便是肿瘤唯一的解法。

\- Neither is unlikely. No one is willing to give up the benefits that they have already gained but do not belong to them, everyone wants more. The former is a slow collective suicide, and the latter is a full-scale social turmoil. The gap of human desires cannot be filled. Education can never catch up with the speed of change! Then “acceleration” is the only solution for tumors.

永远年轻，永远热泪盈眶！

\- Forever young, forever with tears in the eyes!
