只讲党性不讲人性，形容的是那些忽视或压抑人性多样性、个性特色、情感需求的人，ta们可能过于强调党性的普遍性和一致性，而忽视了党性与个性的辩证关系。ta们可能认为党性就是绝对正确和高尚的，而人性就是相对错误和低下的。

\- Talking only about party spirit and not about human nature describes those who ignore or suppress the diversity of human nature, individual characteristics, and emotional needs. They may overemphasize the universality and consistency of party spirit and ignore the dialectical relationship between party spirit and individuality. They may think that party spirit is absolutely correct and noble, while human nature is relatively wrong and low.

大概指的就是那些——“戴着袖标”便意识不了错误，或错误相对或绝对正确的类宗教性质的——疯狂信徒。

\- It probably refers to those crazy believers who are unaware of their mistakes or the relative or absolute correctness of their mistakes when wearing armbands – those with a religious nature.
