根据：\[\*\*原子弹和食人魔鬼｜Atomic bomb and man-eating demon\*\*\](https://www.notion.so/Atomic-bomb-and-man-eating-demon-c9738565a19e4f569048e16c5f206371?pvs=21)，写一篇魔幻现实主义小说。

\- Based on: Atomic bomb and man-eating demon, write a magical realism novel.

他知道那一天会来，他总是知道。他从小就有一种预知能力，可以感觉到未来发生的事情。他不知道这是为什么，也不知道这是怎么发生的。他只知道这是一个秘密，一个不能告诉其他任何人的秘密。

\- He knew that day would come, he always knew. He had a premonition ability since he was young and could sense things that would happen in the future. He didn’t know why or how it happened. He only knew it was a secret, one that he couldn’t tell anyone else.

他预知到了那场大爆炸，那场改变了一切的大爆炸。他预知到了那柱光束，那柱比太阳还更耀眼的光束。和那股能够摧毁一切的冲击波，以及那种无处可逃的恐惧。

\- He foresaw the big explosion, the one that changed everything. He foresaw the beam of light, brighter than the sun. And the shock wave that could destroy everything, and the fear that there was nowhere to escape.

他也预知到了她，他最爱的她。她怀了他们的孩子；她生产了，是一个女儿；她死在了大爆炸之后……

\- He also foresaw her, his beloved. She was pregnant with their child; she gave birth to a daughter; she died after the big explosion…

他没有办法阻止这一切，他只能尽力保护她和他们的女儿。他们逃离城市，躲进了乡下一个偏僻的村庄。他找到了一个安全地方，一个有着厚实的墙壁和坚固的屋顶的地方。他在那里安顿下来，等待着大爆炸发生。他知道那一天会来，他总是知道。

\- He couldn’t stop it all, he could only do his best to protect her and their daughter. They fled the city and hid in a remote village in the countryside. He found a safe place with thick walls and a sturdy roof. He settled there and waited for the big explosion to happen. He knew that day would come, he always knew.

那一天终于来了，就像他预知的那样。他看到了那柱光束，那柱比太阳还更耀眼的光束。他感觉到了那股冲击波，那股能够摧毁一切的冲击波。他听到了那种噪音，那种震耳欲聋的噪音。

\- That day finally came, just as he had foreseen. He saw the beam of light, brighter than the sun. He felt the shock wave that could destroy everything. He heard the noise, deafening.

他紧紧地抱住了她和他们的女儿，用自己的身体为她们挡住了外面的危险。他闭上了眼睛，祈祷着一切都会好起来。他不知道这是不是最后一次拥抱她们，他只知道这是他最想做的事情。

\- He held her and their daughter tightly, using his own body to shield them from the danger outside. He closed his eyes and prayed that everything would be alright. He didn’t know if this was the last time he would hold them, he only knew it was what he wanted to do most.

大爆炸过后，一切都变得安静了。他慢慢地睁开了眼睛，看着周围的景象。他惊讶地发现，他们还活着，他们还完好无损。他感到了一丝欣喜，一丝希望。

\- After the big explosion, everything became quiet. He slowly opened his eyes and looked at the scene around him. To his surprise, they were still alive and unharmed. He felt a glimmer of joy and hope.

但是，这种欣喜和希望很快就被恐惧和绝望所取代。因为他看到了她，他最爱的她。她的身体发生了变化，她的身体变成了十个不同的部分。她的头、胸、腹、臂、腿、手、足、眼、耳、口，都分离了开来，悬浮在空中，围绕着他们的女儿旋转。

\- But this joy and hope were soon replaced by fear and despair. Because he saw her, his beloved. Her body had changed and had become ten different parts. Her head, chest, abdomen, arms, legs, hands, feet, eyes, ears and mouth were all separated and floating in the air, revolving around their daughter.

她不再是她了，她变成了十个食人魔鬼。食人魔鬼是大爆炸之下诞生的怪物，它们以人类的肉体为食，它们以人类的灵魂为乐。它们无法被杀死，它们只能被吞噬。

\- She was no longer herself; she had become ten man-eating demons. Man-eating demons were monsters born under the big explosion. They fed on human flesh and reveled in human souls. They could not be killed; they could only be devoured.

他不敢相信自己的眼睛，他不敢相信这是真的。他想要叫喊，想要哭泣，想要逃跑。但是他什么也做不了，因为食人魔鬼已经发现了他，已经盯上了他。

\- He couldn’t believe his eyes; he couldn’t believe it was true. He wanted to scream, cry and run away. But he couldn’t do anything because the man-eating demons had already found him and were staring at him.

食人魔鬼向他扑来，用它们锋利的牙齿和利爪撕裂了他的身体。他感觉到了剧烈的疼痛，感觉到了生命的流逝。他看着女儿，看着自己唯一剩下的希望。

\- The man-eating demons pounced on him and tore his body apart with their sharp teeth and claws. He felt intense pain and felt life slipping away. He looked at his daughter, his only remaining hope.

女儿没有受到伤害，女儿还活着。女儿被食人魔鬼保护着，被食人魔鬼宠爱着。女儿是食人魔鬼的主人，女儿是食人魔鬼的王。

\- The daughter was not hurt; she was still alive. She was protected by the man-eating demons and loved by them. She was the master of the man-eating demons; she was their queen.

女儿看着他，看着自己唯一剩下的亲人。女儿没有哭泣，没有害怕，没有同情。女儿只有一种表情，一种冷漠的表情。女儿对他说了一句话，一句让他心碎的话。

\- The daughter looked at him, her only remaining relative. She didn’t cry, wasn’t afraid, and didn’t show any sympathy. She had only one expression, a cold one. She said a sentence to him, one that broke his heart.

“爸爸，你是我的食物。”

\- “Daddy, you are my food.”

他听到了这句话，他明白了一切。他明白了自己的命运，他明白了女儿的身份。他明白了食人魔鬼的目的，他明白了大爆炸的意义。

\- He heard this sentence and understood everything. He understood his fate and his daughter’s identity. He understood the purpose of the man-eating demons and the meaning of the big explosion.

他明白了，这一切都是为了女儿，为了食人魔鬼的王。女儿是食人魔鬼的产物，女儿是食人魔鬼的继承者。女儿是一个新的生命形式，女儿是一个新的世界秩序。

\- He understood that it was all for his daughter, for the queen of the man-eating demons. The daughter was a product of the man-eating demons; she was their heir. She was a new form of life; she was a new world order.

他想要反抗，想要拯救自己和人类。但是他什么也做不了，因为食人魔鬼已经吞噬了他，已经消化了他。他感觉到了自己的灵魂被撕裂，感觉到了自己的意识被破坏。

\- He wanted to resist and save himself and humanity. But he couldn’t do anything because the man-eating demons had devoured him and digested him. He felt his soul being torn apart and his consciousness being destroyed.

他最后看到的只是女儿的眼睛，那双冰冷而深邃的眼睛。那双眼睛里没有爱，没有恨，没有情感。那双眼睛里只有一种东西，一种无尽的饥饿。

\- The last thing he saw were his daughter’s eyes, those cold and deep eyes. There was no love, no hate, no emotion in those eyes. There was only one thing in those eyes: endless hunger.

这就是故事的结束，也是人类的结局。这就是魔鬼的开始，也是食人的开端。

\- This is the end of the story and the end of humanity. This is the beginning of the devil and the beginning of cannibalism.
