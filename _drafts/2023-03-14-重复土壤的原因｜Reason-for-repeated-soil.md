是奴才习惯性进行，自我主动式的阉割？不断培育，生产悲剧理所应当重复的土壤。还是真就被胁迫，不得有误地遵循，至上而下部门的所有要求？可能后者犹豫，会思考自己是不是还有别的选择；前者，深入骨髓的执行基因，已然不允许ta们再有一丝，多余的想法了。

\- Is it the servant who habitually performs self-initiated castration? Constantly cultivating and producing the soil where tragedy should be repeated. Or is it really being coerced and must follow all the requirements of the top-down department without error? The latter may hesitate and think about whether they have other choices; the former, the deeply ingrained execution gene, no longer allows them to have a single extra thought.

教育塑造人格，形成社会潮流，继而影响政策，由此产生一系列变化，再导致教育一次次修改和制定，陷入恶性循环。归根结底，“教育”的方式错了。

\- Education shapes personality, forms social trends, and then influences policies, resulting in a series of changes, leading to education being revised and formulated again and again, falling into a vicious circle. In the final analysis, the way of ‘education’ is wrong.
