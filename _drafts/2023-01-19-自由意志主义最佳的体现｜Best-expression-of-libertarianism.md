即便某个人选择ta错误的死亡方式，伴有时长痛苦，但只要是ta自己的选择，只要个人感到幸福、快乐，就要学会尊重。期间，作为旁人，可以提出意见、提供建议甚至批评，但也一定不要阻止。

\- Even if someone chooses Wrong way of death, accompanied by Long Pain, But as long as it is own choice, as long as the individual feels Happiness, Joy, Must learn to respect. During this period, as a Bystander, can put forward opinions, provide suggestions and even criticize, But also be sure not to stop.

因为，这侵犯了一个人生前，自己决定如何死亡，最后一项的权利。

\- Because, this violates a person’s Last Right previous life, Self determine how to die.

个人观点。

\- Personal view.
