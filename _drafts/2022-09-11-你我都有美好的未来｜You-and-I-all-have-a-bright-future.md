社会身份、等级的划分，往往是由，现实的冷嘲热讽，所决定的。比如，看见当官的、美丽的，很多人就前去巴结；瞧见衣衫褴褛、要饭的，就跑去施舍。

\- The division of social status and rank, is often determined by the mockery and irony of reality. For example, when see officials and beauties, many people go to compliment them; when see beggars in ragged clothes, run to give alms.

换一个思维：看见当官的，就上前吐一两抹口水；瞧见要饭的，就伸腿踢（zua）飞ta乞食的家伙。当官的，跪下来求饶；要饭的，站起来给一耳光。

\- Change a mind: When see an official, go up to spit a spit or two; when a beggar, stretch out a leg to kick the guy’s begging tool away. Official, kneel down and beg for mercy; beggar, stand up and slap the kick-man a face.

乞一天食和享一辈子清福……当官的要饭，要饭的当官，你我都有美好的未来。

\- Begging for a day and enjoying a lifetime… Official go to beg, and beggar go to be an official, you and i all have a bright future.
