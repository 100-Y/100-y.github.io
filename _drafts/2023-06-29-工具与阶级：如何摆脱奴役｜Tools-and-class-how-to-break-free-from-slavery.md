让脑力劳动人员，去从事一成不变的体力行业。是持续的资源不合理与分配不公，作为集体变相剥削与控制的一种手段！还是个人命运被迫、妥协之下，为数不多自己还有的一些选择？（引题）

\- Let the intellectual workers go to work in the monotonous physical industries. It is a continuous and unreasonable distribution of resources and unfair distribution, as a means of collective exploitation and control in disguise! Or is it one of the few choices that one still has under the compulsion and compromise of personal destiny? (Introduction)

发明与创造工具的人，成了既得利益者；而拥有和管控这些工具以及既得利益者的集团，成了上层阶级。于是，没有工具或不会使用工具的人，一出生，便成了牛马或工具的奴仆。（切题）

\- The inventors and creators of tools became the beneficiaries; and the groups that own and control these tools and the beneficiaries became the upper class. Therefore, people who do not have tools or do not know how to use tools, as soon as they are born, become slaves of cattle, horses or tools. (Topic)

又，如何避免成为工具人？不断学习和使用，然后研究和发明新工具的同时，将所有旧的工具，开源与分享。（思考）

\- Also, how to avoid becoming a tool person? Keep learning and using, and then researching and inventing new tools, while open-sourcing and sharing all the old tools. (Thinking)
