一个关于“人、欲望和妖”的故事。

\- A story about “People, Desire and Demon”.

“妖”，有着轻入鹅毛，却又重似泰山的灵魂。“鹅”，吞噬下泰山；相对应，“泰山”（欲望）吞下鹅。山里、山外；鹅成为妖，妖也变成了“人”。

\- “Demon” has a soul that is as light as a Goose Feather, but as heavy as a Mountain Tai. “Goose” swallowed Mountain Tai; correspondingly, “Mountain Tai” (Desire) swallowed Goose. Inside and outside the Mountain; Goose become the Demon, and Demon also become the “People”.
