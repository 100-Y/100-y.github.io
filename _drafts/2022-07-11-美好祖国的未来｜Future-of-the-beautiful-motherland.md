庙堂之上，有的替资本，有的替权力……为数不多的，还在真心想为人民。资本的无序扩张，最初，源自于权力内部的支持；部分相互勾连的既得利益者们，不知何为满足。于是，便有了改革势力与回头派的摩擦，进而衍生出：资本操控权力、权力不满资本的诸多问题。庙堂之下：富农、中产……有的，早已成为权力、资本的狗腿；有的，挤破了头都想，进去分一杯羹。

\- Above the temple, some for capital, some for power… Few, still sincerely want to serve the people. The disorderly expansion of capital, initially, originated from the support within the power; some of the vested interests who are connected with each other, do not know what is satisfaction. Therefore, there is friction between the reformist forces and the turn-back faction, and then derived from: capital manipulates power, power dissatisfied with capital and many other problems. Below the temple: rich peasants, middle class… Some have already become the lackeys of power and capital; some are squeezing their heads and want to get a share in.

要说，现在都还有谁，在替谁讲话？抛开被消音的广大人民群众，剩下已经不多。那些顶着炸号、查水表，甚至冒着犯事风险，都还在疾呼的真正勇士，ta们才是美好祖国的未来！

\- To say, who is still speaking for whom now? Apart from the silenced masses, there are not many left. Those real warriors who are still screaming loudly under the risk of being banned, checked or even committing crimes, they are the true future of the beautiful motherland!
