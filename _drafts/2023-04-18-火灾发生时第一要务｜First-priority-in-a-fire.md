当是保持理性，自救。先断电、然后寻找水源，明白此消彼长的道理。而不是盲目听话，或慌不择路、或无所适从；最后，等待救援到来的同时，也一并接收死亡正式的宣判。

\- Is to remain rational and self-rescue. First, turn off the electricity, then look for a water source and understand the principle of give and take. Instead of blindly obeying or panicking and choosing the wrong path or being at a loss; finally, while waiting for rescue to arrive, also accept the official sentence of death.
