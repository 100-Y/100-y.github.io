高一，班级里评选“优秀共青团员”，每个小组选一人。前提是，需要征询所有小组成员的意见。经过大家一致的商讨，推选小组长为所在小组的优秀团员代表。

\- In the first year of high school, “Outstanding Communist Youth League Members” were selected in the class, and each team selected one. The premise is that all team members opinions need to be consulted. After everyone’s unanimous discussion, team leader was elected as the representative of Outstanding Communist Youth League Member of the team.
