在这个大花园里，有很多美丽而香甜的花朵，也有一些隐匿在阴暗处的虫子。它们偷偷地啃噬着花朵的根茎和叶片，让花园生去了光彩和沃力。请问我们这些普通的游客，如何能够把这些虫子揪出来，让它们受到应有的惩罚呢？

\- In this large garden, there are many beautiful and sweet-smelling flowers, as well as some insects hiding in the dark. They secretly gnaw at the roots and leaves of the flowers, making the garden lose its luster and vitality. How can we ordinary tourists pull out these bugs and make them receive the punishment they deserve?

就拿花园里的管理规则和指导方针为例。它们旨在保护花朵的健康和美丽，规范游客和园丁的行为，营造一个和谐有序的环境。其中有一些规则是关于如何在花园里使用手机或者相机的，比如不能随意拍照、上传、评论或者转发花朵的照片；还有一些规则是关于如何选择合适的课外读物给小朋友看的，比如不能含有暴力、色情、反动或者迷信等内容。

\- Take the management rules and guidelines in the garden as an example. They are designed to protect the health and beauty of flowers, regulate the behavior of tourists and gardeners, and create a harmonious and orderly environment. Some of the rules are about how to use mobile phones or cameras in the garden, such as not being able to take pictures, upload, comment or forward photos of flowers at will; there are also some rules about how to choose suitable extracurricular reading materials for children, such as not containing violent, pornographic, reactionary or superstitious content.
