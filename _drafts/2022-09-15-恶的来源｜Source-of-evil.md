恶，是毫无节制的需求；是欲望挣脱瓶颈的牢笼。恶，是意识在对需求和欲望，进行某种向外、非良性方式驱动。所以恶，一定是对外，弊ta的。（自残……那不叫恶，是内在精神不能，自洽、免疫，而呈现出某种矛盾、应激的状态。）

\- Evil, is an uncontrolled Needs; is Desire to break the bottleneck’s cage. Evil, is that Consciousness driving Needs and Desires, in some kind of outward non-benign way. Therefore, Evil must be external and hurt others. (Self-mutilation… that is not called Evil, it is the inability of the Inner Spirit to be self-consistent and immune, and present a state of contradiction and stress.)

需求和欲望，得不到正常满足，转而寻求其它非正常解决手段，而做出的一系列行为与方式。也就是说，需求和欲望，是恶产生的根源。

\- Needs and Desires, cannot be satisfied normally, instead to seek other Abnormal Solutions, and make a series of behaviors and methods. That is to say, Needs and Desires are the source of Evil.
