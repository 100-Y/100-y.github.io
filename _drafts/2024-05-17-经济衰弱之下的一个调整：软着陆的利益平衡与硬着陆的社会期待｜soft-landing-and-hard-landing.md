2024/05/17简而言之，软着陆，是为了尽量减少上层集团的利益损失；而避免硬着陆，目的则是安抚“中产阶级”。至于后来的接盘者，有很多成为了上层集团，这一软着陆过程中，新割的韭菜；还有更多的，在持续观望，寄希望能看到硬着陆的那一天。

\- An adjustment under economic weakness: the balance of interests in a soft landing versus the social expectations of a hard landing.  
\- In short, a soft landing aims to minimize the loss of benefits for the upper echelons; whereas avoiding a hard landing is intended to placate the 'middle class.' As for those who took over later, many became the upper echelons, the newly harvested leeks during this soft landing process; and even more are continuously watching, hoping to witness the day of a hard landing.
