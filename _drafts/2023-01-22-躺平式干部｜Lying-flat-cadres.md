“躺平式干部”不可恶，可恶的是乱作为还要鼓励作为的“四拍干部”。个别人道德缺陷、混吃等死，还好。最坏的是那些广大败类，以权谋私、知法犯法，不仅抢ta人食，还迫害ta们的命。

\- “Lying Flat Cadres” are not abominable, but are “Four Clapping Cadres” who behave indiscriminately and are encouraged to act. It’s okay for some people to have moral flaws, “Eating and Waiting to Die”. Most bad is those vast Scums, use power for personal gain, knowingly break the law, Not only robbed others for food but also persecuted their lives.
