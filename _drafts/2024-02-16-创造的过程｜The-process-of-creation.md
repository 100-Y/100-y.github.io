2024/02/16文字、语言，是一切创意创作，呈现、表达的开始。想象力与思想，则是这一切来自的根源。

\- Words and languages, are the beginning of presentation and expression, of all creativities and creations. Imaginations and thoughts, are the roots from which all this originates.

而，印证、传达、吸收的意识和认知，反哺与促进这样一个循环创造的过程。最终，行动力加辅助执行的额外工具和方法，再呈现表达出各式各样不同的结果。

\- The consciousness and cognition that validate, convey, and absorb, in turn, nourish and promote such a cyclical creative process. Ultimately, the power of action, and the supplemented for execution by additional tools and methods , presents a variety of different results.
