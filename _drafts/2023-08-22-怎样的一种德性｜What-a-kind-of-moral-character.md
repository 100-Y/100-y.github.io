为什么很多人，在一听到某个词语，就心生厌烦的情绪，甚至摆出攻击的姿态？因为，这“某个词语”，将ta们或与之相关的人和事，不由自主地，“准确”联系在了一起。由此觉得受到了巨大冒犯。说明，ta们十分清楚自己原本是怎样的一种德性。

\- Why do many people feel annoyed or even aggressive when they hear a certain word? Because this “certain word” involuntarily connects them or the people and things related to them in a “precise” way. They feel greatly offended by this. This shows that they are very clear about what a kind of moral character they originally have.
