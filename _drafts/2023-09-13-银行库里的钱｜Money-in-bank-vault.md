2023/09/13存在“银行库里”没有遭受监管的钱，被一道又一道的“贩子”，经手和变卖。归根结底遭到剥削的是，存款的“纳税人”。又个人存在“银行库里”的钱是个人的么？某一段时间里，不是个人的；某一段时间内，是。

\- Money in “bank vault” that is not subject to supervision, and it is handled and sold by one after another “dealer”. In the final analysis, the ones who are exploited are the “taxpayers” who deposit the money. Is the money in the “bank vault” personal? For a period of time, it is not; for a period of time, it is.
