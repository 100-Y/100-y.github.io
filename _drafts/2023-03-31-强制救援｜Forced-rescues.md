“强制救援”，不顾生命本体的心理需求，在未征得其情况，生命告知、意愿妥协（同意救援）的前提，便步步紧逼采取，各类主观“为您好”的救助行为。

\- “Forced rescues”, ignoring the psychological needs of life itself, taking various subjective “good for you” rescue actions, without obtaining its situation, life notification, and willing compromise (agreeing to rescue) premise, then step by step is adopted.

导致生命本体，出现伤残、甚至死亡。这样的救援和胁迫、“谋杀”，无太大差异，动机“好与坏”的一个分别。当然是有“错误”，需要承担责任的。

\- Causing life itself to be disabled, or even death. Such rescue and coercion, “murder” have little difference, and one between is the motive of “good and bad”. Of course there are “mistakes”, that need to be responsible.

于双方，救助心理的不同表现。于教育和社会，个人悲痛，本质上，缺乏一种人文关怀的氛围。

\- Regarding both parties, different expressions of rescue psychology. In education and society, the essence of personal grief lacks an atmosphere of humanistic care.
