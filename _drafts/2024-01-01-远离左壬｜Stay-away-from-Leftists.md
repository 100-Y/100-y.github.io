2024/01/01远离左壬：你把左壬当同袍，左壬当你是脚踏石、替死鬼，行走的二等功……

\- Stay away from Leftists: You regard Leftists as comrades, but Leftists see you as stepping stones, scapegoats, and second-class contributors...

左壬：自己不当人，也不把ta人当人。

\- Leftists: They don't regard themselves as human, nor do they regard others as human.

\- Please note that the term "Leftists" might be a specific term or slang in Chinese internet culture, and its meaning could vary based on context.
