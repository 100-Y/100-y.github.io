人存政举，人亡政息。

\- Sage presence, order implement; without sage, order cannot.

原指：好的政令有贤人在就能施行，没有贤人在就不能施行。现多用来强调制度建设的重要性（百度百科）。出自《礼记·中庸》。是站在统治阶级的层面，讲话。

\- Originally refers to: Good government orders can be implemented with the presence of sages, but cannot without. Now it is mostly used to emphasize the importance of system construction (Baidu Baike). From “Book of Rites · Doctrine of the Mean”. It is standing on the level of the ruling class, speeching.

人存，政举；人亡，政熄。

\- People live, government live; people die, government die.

体现：人顽强自由的生命，由不得任何人、任何政令肆无忌惮的摆布和欺压。是站在，作为被统治阶级层面的，反抗。

\- Demonstration: The tenacious and free life of human beings should not be manipulated and oppressed unscrupulously by anyone or any government order. It is standing on the level of the ruled class, resisting.
