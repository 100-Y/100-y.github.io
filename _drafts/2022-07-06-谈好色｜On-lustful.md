有人好色，是真的好色，现实一看见美丽、帅气外表的异性，ta就心生涟漪，甚至图谋不轨：是显性。有人好色，ta也是真的，网络里、无人知道的角落，尽情发泄ta的原始兽欲：是隐性。有的人告诉你，ta好色；有的人说ta自己是颜狗……有的人不说。

\- Some people are lustful, they are really lustful, they see beautiful and handsome people of the opposite sex in reality, they have ripples in their hearts, and even plot something wrong: it is obvious. Some people are lustful, they are also true, in the network, in the corners where no one knows, they vent their primitive animal desires: it is hidden. Some people tell you that they are lustful; some people say they are face dogs… Some people don’t say.

有没不好色的人呢？难说！我只能说我自己。我是属于识趣、理性、随机应变的那种。

\- Are there people who are not lustful? Hard to say! I can only speak for myself. I belong to the kind of person who is sensible, rational, and adaptable.
