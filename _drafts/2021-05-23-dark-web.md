所谓暗网（Dark Web），指的是使用特定浏览器（Tor等），才能浏览、搜索到的网络，和“明网”Internet（World Wide Web）相反，美其名曰：私密浏览，不被追踪、监管和审查，暗地里也进行一些见不得光的交易，比如黑客攻击、毒品买卖等……

使用和搭建（Onion）平台的人少之又少，更多的是欧美地区的用户和某些华人，大都是一些无政府主义的人在使用。简单归纳就是：人性自我冲突的产物。

The so-called dark web refers to the network that can only be browsed and searched using a specific browser (such as Tor), which is opposite to the “clear web” internet (World Wide Web). It is named as: private browsing, not being tracked, monitored and censored, and also conducting some shady transactions in secret, such as hacker attacks, drug trafficking, etc…

There are very few people who use and build (Onion) platforms, mostly users in Europe and America and some Chinese, most of them are anarchists who use them. Simply put, it is: a product of human self-conflict.
