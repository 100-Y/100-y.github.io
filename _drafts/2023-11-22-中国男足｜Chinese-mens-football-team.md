2023/11/22你可以不喜欢中国男足，不支持甚至骂他。但你身为中国人，穿着韩国球员的衣服，举着韩国国旗，站在中国球迷站立的地方，挑衅中国球迷，落得被还击甚至遭受激进球迷击打的地步，只能说是因果报应。这样的个人行为，任是放在其它国家或是联赛，都一样会是无法让广大球迷认可与宽恕的举动。

\- You may not like the Chinese men’s football team, you may not support them, or even criticize them. But as a Chinese person, wearing the jersey of a Korean player, holding the Korean flag, standing where Chinese fans stand, and provoking Chinese fans to the point of being retaliated against or even attacked by radical fans, can only be said to be retribution. Such personal behavior, whether in other countries or leagues, will not be accepted or forgiven by the majority of fans.
