把人性往最坏处想，总是可以避免一些悲剧始料不及地发生。比如路上“挑衅”行驶不规范车辆的行人，车辆转头就可能选择将挑衅的行人碾死。不胜枚举的案例……

\- Thinking of human nature in the worst way can always prevent some tragedies from happening unexpectedly. For example, pedestrians who “provoke” vehicles that do not drive according to regulations on the road may be run over by the vehicle if it turns its head. There are countless cases…

每一身处群体之中单独的个人，都是“坏的”；而ta们各自的坏，也有不同的程度：有的只是言语冲突，有的却不断突破人性的底线。凭借一念之间后的抉择，能够将坏一面的自己控制得住，那么这人，就是“好的”。

\- Every individual in a group is “bad”; and their respective badness also has different degrees: some are just verbal conflicts, while others constantly break through the bottom line of human nature. Relying on the choice after a moment of thought, if one can control their bad side, then this person is “good”.

不要对人性的恶，抱有一丝丝的侥幸！

\- Do not hold a trace of luck on the evil of human nature!
