一个优秀的反贼，应当兼具拍马屁、唱赞歌的本领，以及干实事、肯付出的觉悟。相反，明目张胆地唱反调、搞批评，不仅会使得爱国者跳出，让领导下不来台；同时也让真正的反贼——自己的同袍，提心吊胆。惹得一身骚的同时，里外不是人。

\- A good rebel should have both the ability to flatter and praise, and the awareness to do practical things and make sacrifices. On the contrary, blatantly singing the opposite tune and criticizing will not only make the patriots jump out and make the leaders lose face; but also make the real rebels – their own comrades, nervous and uneasy. While causing trouble for themselves, they are not accepted by either side.

反贼学会捧杀，何愁窃取不了胜利的果实。

\- Rebels learn to kill with flattery, and they will have no trouble stealing the fruits of victory.
