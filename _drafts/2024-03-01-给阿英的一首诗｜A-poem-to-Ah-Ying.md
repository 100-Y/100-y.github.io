2024/03/01目前我所有的烦恼，  
半数源自于你，阿英。  
爱而不得的痛苦，  
时刻折磨我的神经。  
夜里，闲暇时的白天，  
没有一刻不想你。  
而半数，源于我自己。  
我想你太多，把你看得太重、太高了，  
我深怕你从高处跌倒，  
好比我真爱的玩偶摔碎。  
我小心翼翼的将玩偶，捧在手心，  
可，玩偶一点不领我的情。  
可能，我真的真的错的。  
我应该放开玩偶，哪怕眼睁睁看着她摔碎，  
只要她心甘情愿，那就好！

\- All my problems at the moment,  
\- Half of it comes from you, Ah Ying.  
\- The pain of to love but can not own,  
\- Have been torturing my nerves all the time.  
\- At night, during the day in my free time,  
\- Not a moment goes by when I don't think of you.  
\- And half of it, comes from me.  
\- I miss too much of you, think you too high too heavy.  
\- I'm afraid you'll fall,  
\- As if the doll of my true love would break.  
\- I hold the doll carefully, in my hand,  
\- But the doll doesn't appreciate my love at all.

\- Maybe I'm really, really wrong.  
\- I should let go of the doll, even if I have to watch it fall to pieces,  
\- As long as she's willing, that's all right!
