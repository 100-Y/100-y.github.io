个人，利用ta人提供的“信道”，浏览网络“非法”内容。算不得很大的一个问题。但要是独自搭建，再有偿付费给ta人。就要被定性为“现行犯”了。

\- Individuals use the “Channel” provided by others to browse “illegal” content on Internet. Not a big problem. But if build it alone, and provide to others for a fee. It is about to be classified as an “Active Criminal”.

而这一切，个人需要的仅仅只是掌管数台境外服务器，然后了解一些“专业”点的配置知识，就能纯靠“技术”吃饭！同样是“相关企业”，因为受特供单位保护，却不受任何的限制。

\- And for all of this, all self need is to manage a few overseas servers, and then understand some “Professional” configuration knowledge, and can rely solely on “Technology” to make a living! It is also a “Related Enterprise”, because of protected by the Special Supply Unit, but not subject to any restrictions.

有证与无证之间的分别。突出，一个不平等。

\- The difference between certified and unlicensed. Prominently, an Inequality.
