夜色如水，  
低语在氤氲中缠绕。  
幽暗的影子缓缓拉长，  
如梦境的深渊悄然张开。  
洁白如雪的面容，无尽空洞的眼眸……  
“如果注定会被黑暗吞噬，为何心中仍渴望一丝光明的解脱？”  
梦境无声。  
“或许只需一瞬的温度，便能融化那凝结的冰霜。”

- The night is like water,
- Whispers entwine in the mist.
- Dark shadows slowly stretch,
- As the abyss of a dream silently opens.
- A face as white as snow, eyes endlessly hollow…
- "If it's destined to be consumed by darkness, why does the heart still yearn for a glimmer of light to break free?"
- Dreams are silent.
- "Perhaps it only takes a moment of warmth, to melt the frost that has formed."
