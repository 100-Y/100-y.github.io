2023/09/18权力是一把锋利的剑，  
握在手中，能斩断一切；  
也能刺穿大众的心，  
让人沉醉于血腥的美。

\- Power is a sharp sword,  
\- Held in hand, it can cut through everything;  
\- It can also pierce the hearts of the masses,  
\- Making people intoxicated by the beauty of blood.

权力是一团炽热的火，  
燃烧在心中，能照亮四方；  
也能焚毁平凡的身，  
让人迷失于火海的妄。

\- Power is a blazing fire,  
\- Burning in the heart, it can illuminate all directions;  
\- It can also destroy the ordinary body,  
\- Making people lost in the delusion of fire.
