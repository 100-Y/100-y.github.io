在一个遥远的国度，有一个动物管理局，负责管理所有的动物。动物管理局的宗旨是让所有的动物都能和谐共处，不分种族、颜色、大小和能力。为了实现这个目标，动物管理局制定了一套统一的教育制度，要求所有的动物都必须接受相同的课程，学习相同的知识和技能。

\- In a distant kingdom, there was an animal administration bureau responsible for managing all animals. The bureau’s aim was to ensure that all animals could coexist harmoniously, regardless of race, color, size, or ability. To achieve this goal, the bureau established a uniform education system that required all animals to take the same courses and learn the same knowledge and skills.

动物管理局的课程包括：飞行、游泳、跑步、爪击、咬嚼、挖掘、攀爪、吼叫等等。每个动物都必须参加所有的课程，不管它们是否适合或喜欢。动物管理局认为，这样可以让所有的动物都具备最基本的生存能力，也可以消除动物之间的差异和偏见。

\- The bureau’s courses included flying, swimming, running, clawing, biting, digging, climbing, and roaring. Each animal had to participate in all courses regardless of whether they were suitable or liked them. The bureau believed that this would enable all animals to have basic survival skills and eliminate differences and prejudices between them.

动物管理局还设立了一套严格的考核制度，要求所有的动物都必须通过所有的考试，才能毕业和获得证书。考试的标准是一样的，不管是老鹰还是企鹅，都必须能够飞行一定的高度和距离；不管是鲸鱼还是沙漠狐狸，都必须能够游泳一定的速度和时间；不管是狮子还是兔子，都必须能够跑得快、爪得狠、咬得准。

\- The bureau also established a strict assessment system that required all animals to pass all exams to graduate and receive a certificate. The exam standards were the same; whether it was an eagle or a penguin, it had to be able to fly at a certain height and distance; whether it was a whale or a desert fox, it had to be able to swim at a certain speed and time; whether it was a lion or a rabbit, it had to be able to run fast, claw hard and bite accurately.

动物管理局认为，这样可以让所有的动物都达到一个统一的水平，也可以公平地评价动物的优劣。动物管理局还宣传说，只有通过了考试，才能证明自己是一个有用的、有价值的、有尊严的动物；只有拿到了证书，才能在社会上找到一个好工作、过上好生活。

\- The bureau believed that this would enable all animals to reach a uniform level and fairly evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. The bureau also propagated that only by passing the exams could one prove oneself to be a useful, valuable and dignified animal; only by obtaining a certificate could one find a good job and live a good life in society.

在这样的教育制度下，很多动物都感到压力重重、痛苦不堪。有些动物因为不擅长某些课程，而被老师鄙视、同学嘲笑、家长责骂；有些动物因为不喜欢某些课程，而被迫放弃自己的兴趣、才华、梦想；有些动物因为不适应某些课程，而导致身体受伤、精神崩溃、甚至死亡。

\- Under such an education system, many animals felt stressed and miserable. Some animals were despised by teachers, ridiculed by classmates and scolded by parents because they were not good at certain courses; some animals were forced to give up their interests, talents and dreams because they did not like certain courses; some animals were injured physically or mentally collapsed or even died because they were not adapted to certain courses.

但是，也有一些动物对这样的教育制度表示赞同和支持。他们认为，这样可以让所有的动物都有机会学习到各种各样的知识和技能，也可以让所有的动物都有机会展示自己的才能和潜力；他们认为，这样可以让所有的动物都有机会竞争和合作，也可以让所有的动物都有机会进步和成功；他们认为，这样可以让所有的动物都有机会融入社会和被社会接受，也可以让所有的动物都有机会获得幸福和尊重。

\- However, some animals agreed with and supported such an education system. They believed that this would give all animals the opportunity to learn various knowledge and skills and show their talents and potential; they believed that this would give all animals the opportunity to compete and cooperate as well as progress and succeed; they believed that this would give all animals the opportunity to integrate into society and be accepted by society as well as achieve happiness and respect.

这些动物通常是那些在考试中表现优秀、在社会中地位高昂、在生活中享受富裕的动物。他们对动物管理局的教育制度充满了感激和忠诚，也对其他不同意见的动物充满了鄙视和敌意。

\- These animals were usually those who performed well in exams, had high social status and enjoyed affluent lives. They were grateful for the bureau’s education system and loyal to it while being contemptuous of other animals with different opinions.

在这样的教育制度下，动物们渐渐失去了自己的特色、个性、创造力和自由。他们变成了一群机械的、单一的、无趣的和服从的动物。他们不再关心自己真正想要的是什么，只关心自己能不能通过考试，能不能拿到证书，能不能找到工作，能不能赚到钱，能不能得到尊重。他们不再追求自己的梦想、热情、幸福和快乐，只追求动物管理局的目标、规则、评价和奖励。

\- Under such an education system, animals gradually lost their characteristics, personalities, creativity and freedom. They became mechanical, monotonous, boring and obedient animals. They no longer cared about what they really wanted but only cared about whether they could pass exams or get certificates or find jobs or earn money or gain respect. They no longer pursued their dreams, passions, happiness or joy but only pursued the bureau’s goals, rules evaluations or rewards.

这样的教育制度，真的是为了动物们的利益吗？真的是为了动物们的和谐吗？真的是为了动物们的进步吗？真的是为了动物们的尊严吗？

\- Is such an education system really for the benefit of animals? Is it really for their harmony? Is it really for their progress? Is it really for their dignity?

或许，这样的教育制度，只是为了动物管理局自己的利益。只是为了让动物管理局能够控制所有的动物，让所有的动物都听从动物管理局的命令，让所有的动物都为动物管理局服务，让所有的动物都成为动物管理局的奴隶。

\- Perhaps such an education system is only for the benefit of the animal administration bureau itself. It is only for the bureau to control all animals so that all animals obey its orders serve it and become its slaves.

或许，这样的教育制度，只是一个灌输、洗脑的过程。

\- Perhaps such an education system is just a process of indoctrination.
