教育，是一口旧锅，  
被时代的手反复搬动：  
它煮沸忠诚，  
翻炒人才，  
又悄然熬起认同的浓汤。

而那本应点燃我们的火，  
却始终不曾升起。

或许，我们该砸碎这口锅，  
拾起碎片，  
生一炉只属于自己的火。  
让教育不再为谁所用，  
只为人成其为人。

Education is an old pot,  
moved again and again by the hands of history—  
it once boiled loyalty,  
then stir-fried talent,  
and now simmers a silent broth of belonging.

Yet the flame meant to ignite _us_  
never truly rose.

Perhaps it's time to shatter this pot,  
gather its shards,  
and kindle a fire that is wholly our own.  
Let education serve no one,  
but simply let us become who we are.
