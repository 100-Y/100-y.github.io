这个世界不打疫苗的人，已经很少；核酸不做、健康码也不使用的，更是奇葩；最绝的是……ta们压根不慌。小到，不要郊游照；大到，撕毁毕业报道证，连档案都丢弃。社保卡，一系列卡；良民证，诸多良民证……有的没的，各种buff叠加。

\- There are very few people in this world who don’t get vaccinated; those who don’t do nucleic acid tests or use health codes are even more rare; the most extreme is… they don’t panic at all. From small things, like not wanting to take pictures of outings; to big things, like tearing up graduation report certificates, and even discarding files. Social security card, a series of cards; good citizen certificate, many good citizen certificates… all kinds of buffs stacked.

条条框框等无用的东西，在这类人眼里看来，只是阻碍人类进步的拦脚石；同时，ta们也深知：这些都是杀死ta们，最为锋利的钝器。

\- Rules and regulations and other useless things, in the eyes of these people, are just stumbling blocks that hinder human progress; at the same time, they also know: these are the most sharp blunt weapons to kill them.
