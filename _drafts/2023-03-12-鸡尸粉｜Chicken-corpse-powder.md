在梦中，小李是一名侦探，他被派去调查一个村子发生的一起离奇的命案。案发现场没有任何线索，只有被咬得面目全非的尸体。小李怀疑这是一起人为制造的谋杀案，而且凶手就藏在这个村子里。

\- In the dream, Xiao Li is a detective who was sent to investigate a bizarre murder case that occurred in a village. There were no clues at the scene of the crime, only a body that was bitten beyond recognition. Xiao Li suspected that this was a murder case created by humans, and the murderer was hiding in this village.

经过仔细的侦查，小李发现了一个隐藏在某户人家后院的秘密通道。他沿着通道进入了地下，发现了一个惊人的秘密：这里竟然饲养着一条巨大的蟒蛇，而且这条蟒蛇还会吐出致命的毒液。小李立刻意识到，这条蟒蛇就是凶手所用的凶器，只要它从地下钻出来，在夜晚袭击无辜的村民，然后再回到地下藏身，就能轻易逃避追查。

\- After careful investigation, Xiao Li discovered a secret passage hidden behind a household’s backyard. He followed the passage underground and discovered an amazing secret: there was actually a huge python being raised here, and this python could spit out deadly venom. Xiao Li immediately realized that this python was the murder weapon used by the murderer. As long as it emerged from underground at night to attack innocent villagers and then returned underground to hide, it could easily evade investigation.

小李跟随着通道继续前进，发现了另一个出口。那是一个位于路边的窨井盖，也是一个通风口。窨井盖上方有一根铁链子固定着一只死去的家鸡。小李猜测，这只家鸡可能是用来引诱蟒蛇出来作案的诱饵。但奇怪的是，这只家鸡已经死了很久了，却没有散发出任何恶臭。

\- Xiao Li continued along the passage and found another exit. It was a manhole cover located on the side of the road and also a vent. Above the manhole cover was an iron chain that fixed a dead chicken. Xiao Li guessed that this chicken might have been used as bait to lure out the python for committing crimes. But strangely, this dead chicken had been dead for a long time and did not emit any odor.

小李带着他的同伴返回住所，在那里分析和梳理案件的来龙去脉。他们推断：第二天肯定会有人来收走那只死去的家鸡，并且换上新鲜的诱饵。而那只家鸡之所以不会臭掉，可能是因为吃了一种叫做“鸡尸粉”的东西。这种东西是由邻居家一个自称“小道士”的年轻人提供给凶手家族使用的。

\- Xiao Li returned to his residence with his companions and analyzed and sorted out the details of the case there. They speculated that someone would come to take away the dead chicken and replace it with fresh bait the next day. And the reason why this dead chicken did not smell bad might be because it ate something called “chicken corpse powder”. This thing was provided by a young man named “Little Taoist” from a neighbor’s family for use by the murderer’s family.

第二天早上，在路上布置好埋伏后，“收鸡”的队伍很快就露出了马脚。他们分别被小李和他的同伴抓住，并带回审讯。经过审问和对证后，案件真相终于水落石出。

\- The next morning, after setting up an ambush on the road, the “chicken collection” team quickly revealed their true colors. They were caught respectively by Xiao Li and his companions and taken back for interrogation. After questioning and verifying evidence, the truth of the case finally came to light.
